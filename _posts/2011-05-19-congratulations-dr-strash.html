Congratulations to Darren Strash, who passed his thesis defense today! Darren was co-advised by Mike Goodrich and me; his thesis combines research results from four papers on <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.0893">fast algorithms for geometric graphs with a sublinear number of crossings</a> (such as road networks), <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0812.3893">greedy embedding</a> (a technique for giving coordinates to sensor networks to allow simple routing algorithms to work), and <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.5440">clique-finding algorithms</a> and <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.0318">their implementation</a>.
