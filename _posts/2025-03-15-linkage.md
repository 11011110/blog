"Unfortunately, bad science published by IEEE isnâ€™t limited to boring applications of boring algorithms to boring data": the post goes on to describe IEEE publications about computer-enhanced ayurveda, astrology, the supernatural potential of 5G cellphone signals in scientific traditional Chinese medicine, electro-homeopathy, and even two recent papers on perpetual motion.

For $$3\times 3$$ matrices, there are three off-diagonal terms and you get a three-dimensional curved tetrahedron sitting inside a unit cube. It's a special case of a [spectrahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrahedron). Via [a Blue Sky post](https://web-cdn.bsky.app/profile/bbolker.bsky.social/post/3lakemxuvf22z) whose image makes clear that it is has a quite different geometry than the Reuleaux tetrahedron: the four tetrahedral faces meet at the straight line-segment edges of a regular tetrahedron, and pillow outward from there. Instead the Reuleaux tetrahedron's edges are circular arcs where two spheres meet.
