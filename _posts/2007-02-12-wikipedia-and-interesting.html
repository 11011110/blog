The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interesting_number_paradox">interesting number paradox</a> results from attempting to classify numbers as interesting or dull according to whether there is some simply-stated property that describes the number; for instance 255 is interesting (some might say) because it&#x27;s the smallest perfect totient number with three different prime factors. The paradox comes from trying to find the value of the smallest number that is not interesting.
<br />

<br />
But: Wikipedia also has a description of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Numbers#How_Far_To_Go.3F">notable numbers</a> that seems essentially the same as the interesting numbers: &quot;numbers with some remarkable mathematical property&quot;. There is at any point in time a smallest integer not deemed notable by the WP editors (as of today, that number is 202). And as &quot;not deemed notable by the WP editors&quot; is a property that is itself neither mathematical nor deemed remarkable by the WP editors, there is no paradox!
<br />

<br />
So is the disappearance of this paradox itself a paradox?

&quot;43:
 The first &quot;Uninteresting Number&quot; -- isn&#x27;t that interesting?
     This is sort of a joke among Mathematicians, as it proves that NO 
     integers are uninteresting.  Trivially, though:
     the 42-gonal Pyramidal Number 42Pyr(2),
     the 41-dimensional Centered Tetrahedral Number 412dCT(2)&quot;
