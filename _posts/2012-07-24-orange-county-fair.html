<p>Like <a href="{{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2011-07-19-photos-from-orange %}">last year</a>, we went to the Orange County Fair this year to see Sara&#x27;s photos (she had three in the youth photo exhibit) and stayed for the other activities: the midway, fried food booth after fried food both, wine tasting, acrobat show, etc.</p>
