<p><a href="http://easttotemwest.com/">East Totem West</a> was a late-1960s publisher of psychadelic posters, located in Mill Valley near San Francisco. My friend John Sisson (the biology librarian at UCI, below in the green shirt) collects their posters, and recently put on an exhibit of them at the Orange County Friends Meeting House in Irvine. <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/easttotemwest/">My photos of the show are online here</a>.</p>
