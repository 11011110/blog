* [Robin Houston wonders about cuboid terminology](https://mathstodon.xyz/@robinhouston/112013011011016195). The specific question is whether it should mean a shape with six rectangular sides (as commonly taught in school) or a shape with six quadrilateral sides (as used in some research communities). Let's not even speak about Branko Gr√ºnbaum's use of it to mean a shape formed by gluing together a power-of-two number of six-quad-side shapes.

* Tiny [period-15 glider gun](https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Period-15_glider_gun) and [period-16 glider gun](https://conwaylife.com/wiki/Period-16_glider_gun) in Conway's Game of Life <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mstdn.social/@generations/112025007663112597)).</span>

I think part of what made it good is that, in the selections from each artist, the artist's intent was clearly visible: they were human-made artworks, but made using AI generation as a medium.

* [Computation from one-dimensional particle collision systems](https://www.univ-orleans.fr/lifo/Members/Jerome.Durand-Lose/Recherche/AGC/intro_AGC.html) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/112087122662202342),</span> [via](https://lobste.rs/s/pfysdw/abstract_geometrical_computation)). At first glance these look a lot like 1d cellular automata, and can be proven universal through simulation of 1d CA, but they have some other phenomena as well, involving infinitely many collision events happening within a finite time and space.

* The following appears to be an open problem <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/112092724446228275)):</span> what is the expected number of vertices of the convex hull of $$n$$ random points in a regular octahedron? The context for this is a 1988 paper by Rex Dwyer,  "On the convex hull of random points in a polytope" (J. Applied Probability, 1988, [doi:10.2307/3214289](https://doi.org/10.2307/3214289), [jstor:3214289\(https://www.jstor.org/stable/3214289)). Dwyer shows that, for uniformly random points in a fixed <span style="white-space:nowrap">$$d$$-dimensional</span> convex polytope, the expected number of convex hull vertices <span style="white-space:nowrap">is $$O(\log^{d-1} n)$$.</span> He proves a matching lower bound for simple polytopes (including hypercubes) and more strongly for polytopes that have at least one simple vertex. A colleague asked me today about the case for cubes; Dwyer's paper provides the answer. Dwyer poses as an open problem whether the lower bound can be extended to all convex polytopes. The octahedron is the least complicated polytope not covered by Dwyer's results. My searches didn't find any followup papers improving on Dwyer, but maybe someone else knows of more.
