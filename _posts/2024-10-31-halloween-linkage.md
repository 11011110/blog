Matteo Gallet, Georg Grasegger, Jan Legerský, and Josef Schicho. Convex polyhedra are rigid, but some special non-convex polyhedra have at least one continuous degree of freedom. (More than one degree of freedom can be obtained in a trivial way by gluing such polyhedra.) The [Bricard octahedra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bricard_octahedron) have the same combinatorial structure as a regular octahedron, and can sort of flex, but only if you allow faces that can cross through each other. You can avoid the crossings, for instance by making little gussets near where they would happen, at the expense of making the shape more complicated.

  It was believed that Steffen's polyhedron, with 9 vertices, 21 edges, and 14 triangular faces, was the simplest possible non-self-intersecting flexible polyhedron. For instance, Demaine and O'Rourke's book _Geometric Folding Algorithms_ (p. 347) writes "As it was later proven that all triangulated polyhedra of eight vertices are rigid, Steffen’s example is minimal in this sense." But it was apparently not proven, and the new preprint claims a better example: an 8-vertex polyhedron formed from a pentagonal bipyramid by subdividing one triangle into three. This seems a bizarre choice because this subdivision does not affect flexibility. But it can act as a gusset pulling two parts of the boundary away from each other, changing a self-crossing bipyramid into a non-self-crossing subdivided bipyramid.

  So anyway, let that be an excuse for some RSS evangelism. RSS is not dead! Find an RSS reader and use it collect all the blogs and magazines and newspapers and other online sources that you want to keep up with. You can't read everything, but if you're going to be enclosed in a bubble, let it be one where you are your own gatekeeper.

This posting by Cabells reports on an unrelated site calling themselves (at that time) "predatoryreports.org", maintaining their own separate list and seeking large fees from journal publishers in exchange for removal from the list. I found out about this through [a Wikipedia discussion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:MDPI) where another editor stated that the publication of this post by Cabells, some nine months ago, had led to a shakeup, of sorts: the predator-of-predators changed the word "reports" in their name to "journals". Sure enough, now predatoryreports.org redirects to Cabells as it should, but the splash screen for predatoryjournals.org looks pretty much the same as the screenshot from the Cabells post.

Draw a (possibly non-convex) 11-gon in a triangular lattice such that equilateral triangles pointing inward from its vertices do not intersect except at the 11-gon vertices. Then the part of the 11-gon between the triangles is a [net](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_(polyhedron)) for a tiled polyhedron (its [star unfolding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_unfolding)), and every tiled polyhedron can be generated in this way.

* [A lower bound for the quickhull convex hull algorithm that disproves the quickhull precision conjecture](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4989035) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/113400094218315111)),</span> a new SSRN preprint by Mike Goodrich. Mike tells me that he didn't actually intend to post this as a preprint but must have clicked the wrong button trying to submit it to an Elsevier journal. But I think that making it public in this way, even accidentally, is relatively harmless, this time. Oh, the result? It's about [quickhull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quickhull), an algorithm for 2d convex hulls. It is known that
  - Quickhull on worst-case inputs with unbounded coordinates takes $$O(n^2)$$ time, and no better bound is possible.
  - Quickhull on random points in a convex region takes $$O(n)$$ expected time.
  - Quickhull on points with integer coordinates of polynomial size takes $$O(n\log n)$$ time.
  - Quickhull on inputs whose hull has $$h$$ edges takes $$O(nh)$$ time.

  There was a conjecture from 1996 that the last two of these bounds could be combined: that quickhull on points with  integer coordinates of polynomial size and $$h$$ hull edges takes $$O(n\log h)$$ time. The conjecture is wrong.  Quickhull is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively partitions its input in a certain way. The optimality of $$O(n^2)$$ can be shown using $$n$$ points with exponential coordinates, causing these splits to be highly uneven.  The new counterexample is the same construction with $$h$$ points, for $$h$$ small enough to produce polynomially-large coordinates, plus $$n-h$$ points that get carried along for the ride through $$h$$ levels of recursion. This shows that the combination of known time bounds $$O\bigl(\min(nh,n\log n)\bigr)$$ is optimal for this case.

* [Pillow box design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17593) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/113404741149929214)),</span> new arXiv preprint by Jun Mitani. You've probably seen and used pillow boxes, even if you don't know the name. They are those ubiquitous small cardboard packages, sort of like a flattened tube with a convex lens-shaped cross-section, with inwardly-curving end caps. They can be folded from a single rectangular sheet of cardboard, with less wasted material than folding a cuboid box, and the curved folds make them quite rigid even when they are made from thin material. In this preprint, Mitani studies the mathematics behind their design, also connecting them to the [teabag problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_bag_problem) asking how much volume can be enclosed between two squares glued edge-to-edge.
