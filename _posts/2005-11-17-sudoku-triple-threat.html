<p>I finally tracked down the &quot;triple threat in bilocal analysis&quot; bug that was occasionally biting my Sudoku program.  More for my own benefit than because I think anyone else might care, here&#x27;s the explanation.</p>


<p>The analysis in question involves drawing a graph, the edges of which connect puzzle cells that are the only two cells in their row, column, or block to contain a specific digit.  We then look for cycles in which no two consecutive edges are labeled by the same digit; in such a cycle each cell can contain only the two digits labeling the adjacent cycle edges. The way my algorithm implements this is to perform strong connectivity analysis in a related directed graph, from which we can test which edges belong to nonrepetitive cycles.  If a cell has edges with two different labels belonging to nonrepetitive cycles, we know that we can eliminate all other digits as possible values for that cell.</p>

<p>But what happens when a cell has edges with three or more different labels, all belonging to nonrepetitive cycles?  Which two digits should we restrict the cell&#x27;s values to?  I used to think that this situation could not arise in a valid Sudoku puzzle, so my code raised an exception in this case.  That was the bug.  It can happen.  Consider for instance the following puzzle:</p>

<p>After some earlier steps (including a previous pass of the same sort of bilocal analysis) we reach the following configuration:</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/0xDE/triple-threat/partial.png" /></p>

<p>Two different cycles are possible here, both sharing the same edges for part of the cycle and diverging for another part:</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/0xDE/triple-threat/cycle2.png" /></p>

<p>Note especially cell R2C8, in the top right corner.  One cycle uses edges labeled 1 and 5 at that cell; the other cycle uses edges labeled 4 and 5.  So this is an example of the triple threat that I raised an exception for.  But it&#x27;s still a valid puzzle: if we restrict R2C8 to contain only 4 and 5, and to contain only 1 and 5, it still has a possible value, 5.  The two cycles together allow us to make a stronger deduction than if we had only one of them.  If there were a third cycle, labeled with 1 and 4, then we would truly have a contradiction, but no such cycle exists.</p>

<p>The easy fix for my program: when doing this sort of bilocal analysis, ignore cells like R2C8 that have cyclic edges with more than two labels.  By ignoring them, we don&#x27;t make certain deductions that we might be able to, but it doesn&#x27;t happen very frequently and when it does it will be caught by the later repetitive cycle rule anyway.</p>
