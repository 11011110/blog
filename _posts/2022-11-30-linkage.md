No, this is not about using CA to study patterns in the sky (though that might be interesting); it is about using [UMAP dimension-reduction techniques](https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to create something like a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for finding CA rules with complex behavior.

My recommendation from the locals for their favorite restaurant was Truco 7, where I had amazing chicken mole for much less than I would have expected. Off the main streets much of the city looks like the photo below: steep narrow alleys with very colorful buildings. Maybe not the best for accessibility.

The example given by Carl T. Bergstrom is for "Brandolini's law, the principle that bullshit takes another of magnitude less effort create than to clean up".

Can you call $$T$$ a "BFS tree"? Or is that only for trees that could be generated by breadth-first search? E.g. consider shortest paths in $$K_{2,3}$$ starting from the 3-vertex side. For breadth first search, two leaves from the 3-vertex side will share a parent. But there is a different shortest path tree where they have different parents. Is it a BFS tree?

* [Extended thread on combinatorial species of linear orderings and permutations by John Baez](https://mathstodon.xyz/@johncarlosbaez/109398225812984155) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](MLINK)).</span> I had the vague impression that a [combinatorial species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_species) and a [combinatorial class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_class) were more or less the same thing: a ranked collection of combinatorial objects, equivalent when they have the same number of objects of each rank. But that's not accurate. It describes classes, but not species, which have a more specific equivalence relation. In particular, the linear orderings and the permutations form the same combinatorial class (they are both counted by the factorials), but different combinatorial species.

* [Who first thought of the notion of Polynomial Time](http://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2022/11/who-first-thought-of-notion-of.html) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/109419856682356083))?</span>  As Gasarch points out, the usual answer of Cobham and Edmonds in 1965 is incorrect. The same distinction, between polynomial and super-polynomial algorithms, already appeared in a 1910 paper of Henry Cabourn Pocklington. In the comments, Martin Berger points to the even-earlier analysis of Euclidean GCD, for which a polynomial bound was known by 1841.

* Not every curvy triangle is a Reuleaux triangle <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/109433756706982819)).</span> Even if you ascribe the greater width than height in the photo (from [a post by Katie Steckles at the Heidelberg Laureate Forum](https://scilogs.spektrum.de/hlf/maths-on-a-plate/)) to an angled perspective, and imagine it to be 3-way symmetric, this plate is too bulgy to be Reuleaux. Still a fun example to find at a mathematics facility, though.
