<p>Cute polygon visibility puzzler from Andy Drucker: <a href="http://andysresearch.blogspot.com/2007/09/in-plane-sight.html">how many equal-sized equilateral triangles can you place in the plane so that each triangle vertex is visible from each other triangle vertex?</a></p>

<p>If you're stuck, here's a <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/2007/andys-triangles.svg">spoilerific illustration</a>...</p>

Thanks, David!
It can also be done with infinitely many triangles at once, but the picture is less pretty...

One additional thing I'd like to know, assuming readers agree with my last statement: must any such infinite arrangement have asymptotic density zero?

Thanks yourself for a fun puzzle.

I assume the answer to your density question must be yes but I don't know how one would go about proving it.
