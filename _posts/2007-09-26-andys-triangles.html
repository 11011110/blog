Cute polygon visibility puzzler from Andy Drucker: <a href="http://andysresearch.blogspot.com/2007/09/in-plane-sight.html">how many equal-sized equilateral triangles can you place in the plane so that each triangle vertex is visible from each other triangle vertex?</a>
<br />

<br />
If you&#x27;re stuck, here&#x27;s a <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/0xDE/andys-triangles.png">spoilerific illustration</a>...

Thanks, David!
It can also be done with infinitely many triangles at once, but the picture is less pretty...

One additional thing I&#x27;d like to know, assuming readers agree with my last statement: must any such infinite arrangement have asymptotic density zero?

Thanks yourself for a fun puzzle.

I assume the answer to your density question must be yes but I don&#x27;t know how one would go about proving it.
