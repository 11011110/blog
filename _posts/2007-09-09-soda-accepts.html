<p>Via <a href="http://mysliceofpizza.blogspot.com/2007/09/soda-unparsed.html">Muthu</a>: the <a href="http://www.cs.bu.edu/~steng/SODA2008accepted.txt">list of accepted papers at the 2008 ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA)</a> is now available.</p>

<p>I'm happy to report that my own submission, the one on <a href="{{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2007-05-08-partial-cube-recognition %}">recognizing partial cubes</a>, is among the accepts. So I'll see you all in San Francisco!</p>

<b>fus</b>: shortest paths<br />

<p>I landed here from looking for algorithms for the k-shortest paths problem, I did find your paper for digraphs as also the Katoh and the Hadjiconstantinou papers, the latter being more relevant since my aim is to find the paths in undirected graphs.</p>

<p>I was wondering if you knew of any existing implementations ?</p>

<p>TIA, and sorry if this is a bother</p>

<p>The implementations of my algorithm that I know of are linked from <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/p-kpath.html">my pub page</a>. But you might also want to look into Hershberger and Suri's <a href="http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~suri/psdir/alenex.pdf">paper on simple paths</a>; the title implies that there's an implementation.</p>
