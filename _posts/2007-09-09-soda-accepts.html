Via <a href="http://mysliceofpizza.blogspot.com/2007/09/soda-unparsed.html">Muthu</a>: the <a href="http://www.cs.bu.edu/~steng/SODA2008accepted.txt">list of accepted papers at the 2008 ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA)</a> is now available.
<br />

<br />
I&#x27;m happy to report that my own submission, the one on <a href="http://11011110.livejournal.com/102786.html">recognizing partial cubes</a>, is among the accepts. So I&#x27;ll see you all in San Francisco!

<b>fus</b>: shortest paths<br />

I landed here from looking for algorithms for the k-shortest paths problem, I did find your paper for digraphs as also the Katoh and the Hadjiconstantinou papers, the latter being more relevant since my aim is to find the paths in undirected graphs.

I was wondering if you knew of any existing implementations ?

TIA, and sorry if this is a bother

The implementations of my algorithm that I know of are linked from <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/p-kpath.html">my pub page</a>. But you might also want to look into Hershberger and Suri&#x27;s <a href="http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~suri/psdir/alenex.pdf">paper on simple paths</a>; the title implies that there&#x27;s an implementation.
