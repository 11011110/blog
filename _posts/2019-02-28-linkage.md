This seems like a good time to throw in a word of appreciation for [archive.org](https://archive.org/) and their wayback machine for making it so easy to make permanent links to online resources that might otherwise go away, such as other people's Google+ posts. Just search for the link on archive.org and, if it's not archived already, it will give you a convenient link to immediately archive it. There's one of those hiding in the links below, and more among the older links on my blog.

* Elsevier news roundup ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/101604919533994937)): [German, Hungarian, and Swedish academics have been cut off from Elsevier journals](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00492-4) after subscription negotiations broke down. [Negotiations with the University of California are ongoing](https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2019/02/01/talks-continue-between-u-california-and-elsevier) after a missed deadline. [Access to Germany was restored](https://www.nature.com/news/german-scientists-regain-access-to-elsevier-journals-1.21482) but without any long-term agreement. And [the editorial board of _Informetrics_ resigned](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00135-8) to protest Elsevier's open access policies.

* [The Rado graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rado_graph) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/101608978698250480)). Choose a random graph with countably infinite vertices by flipping a coin to decide whether to include each edge. Or, construct a graph with binary numbers as vertices, with an edge $$x$$—$$y$$ when $$x\lt y$$ and the $$x$$th bit of $$y$$ is one. Or, construct a graph on primes congruent to 1 mod 4, with an edge when one is a quadratic residue mod the other. They're all the same graph, and it has many other amazing properties.

* [A comparison of two parallel Canadian grant funding tracks](https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/cihr-gender-bias-1.5009611) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/101617210700627060)) shows that when reviewers are told to focus on the investigator rather than the proposed investigation, they are significantly more biased against women.

* Paul Erdős died in 1996, but [his most recent paper](http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~ronspubs/pre_tres_egyptian.pdf) is from 2015, nearly 20 years later! ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/101623126848928532), [see also](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/2015/12/10/new-erdos-paper-solves-egyptian-fraction-problem/)). It's about Egyptian fractions – representations of rationals as sums of distinct unit fractions – and is motivated by the conjecture that it's always possible for all denominators to be semiprime. That's still open, but they prove that every integer has a representation with all denominators products of three primes.

* [You can't pack uncountably many Möbius strips into 3d space](https://www.quantamagazine.org/mobius-strips-defy-a-link-with-infinity-20190220/) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/101625917417129970)). Known since the early 1960s for polyhedral embeddings, this has been recently generalized to arbitrarily messy topological embeddings, and to higher dimensions, in two papers [by Olga Frolkina](https://doi.org/10.1142/S0218216518420051) and [by Sergey Melikhov](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04089).

* [YBC 7289](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YBC_7289) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/101638091102582421)). This Babylonian tablet from 1800 BC – 1600 BC shows the sides and diagonals of a square with a very accurate sexagesimal approximation to the square root of two, "the greatest known computational accuracy ... in the ancient world". Now a Good Article on Wikipedia. 

* [NASA names a building after _Hidden Figures_ subject Katherine Johnson](https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/nasa-names-facility-hidden-figures-inspiration-katherine-johnson/story) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@btcprox/101638679662393655)).

* [Christian Lawson-Perfect 3d-prints interconnecting Herschel enneahedra](https://mathstodon.xyz/@christianp/101651770581756631). This is [the simplest non-Hamiltonian polyhedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herschel_graph). I [wrote a couple years ago]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2016-11-30-linkage %}) about Lawson-Perfect's quest for a nice polyhedral realization for these shapes; now they exist in tangible form.

* [Goldilogs and the $$n$$ bears: a parable of algorithmic efficiency](https://mathlesstraveled.com/2019/02/20/goldilogs-and-the-n-bears/) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/101655938940308411)). 

* [Karl Bringmann and Kasper Green Larsen have won the 2019 Presberger Award](http://eatcs.org/index.php/presburger) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/101665972353816294)), for outstanding contributions by young scientists in theoretical computer science, to be presented later this year at ICALP. The award laudatio appears not to be ready yet but [committee chair Jukka Suomela writes that it is "for their groundbreaking work on lower bounds"](https://web.archive.org/web/20190227203235/https://plus.google.com/+JukkaSuomela/posts/HfEVeR44Bww).

* [The Computational Geometry Week Optimization Challenge](http://cgshop.ibr.cs.tu-bs.de/) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/101667406212632110), [via](https://sites.google.com/stonybrook.edu/cgweek2019-workshop/)) is a contest to solve a hard problem in computational geometry, finding a simple polygon of minimum or maximum area with a given point set as its vertices. The 247 challenge instances are now online, with a deadline of May 31 for solving them.

* [_Problems with a Point: Exploring Math and Computer Science_](https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/11261) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/101672038034600757), [via](https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2019/02/problems-with-point-exploring-math-and.html)), a new book of mathematical essays from Bill Gasarch and Clyde Kruskal, based on expanded and cleaned-up versions of Bill's blog posts at the Computational Complexity blog.
