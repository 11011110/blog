I was thinking again today about <a href="http://11011110.livejournal.com/71062.html">a question I asked some time ago</a>, whether every periodic infinite planar graph (that is, a graph formed by unrolling a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toroidal_graph">toroidal graph</a> onto the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_cover">universal cover</a> of the torus) has a periodic 4-coloring (possibly with a larger fundamental domain).
<br />

<br />
It turns out to be known that there exist periodic infinite planar graphs that are 3-colorable, but for which all 3-colorings are aperiodic. Also, using the same construction, one can show that it&#x27;s undecidable to determine whether a periodic infinite planar graph is 3-colorable. The reference is <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/276698.276871">&quot;<i>k</i>-sat on groups and undecidability&quot;</a>, by Michael Freedman in STOC 1998.
<br />

<br />
So that&#x27;s a hint that the 4-coloring question might be difficult...
