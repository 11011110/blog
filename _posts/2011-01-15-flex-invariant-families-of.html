<p>It&#x27;s time to do some more elementary geometry!</p>

<p>An <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthodiagonal_quadrilateral">orthodiagonal quadrilateral</a> is a quadrilateral whose two diagonals lie on perpendicular lines. A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangential_quadrilateral">tangential quadrilateral</a> is one whose four sides lie on lines that are tangent to a common circle. (I&#x27;ve tried to word these definitions carefully so they work correctly even for nonconvex quads.)</p>

<p>Now, suppose you make one of these quadrilaterals so that the sides are rigid but the corners are hinged, so that the whole thing forms a flexible <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-bar_linkage">four-bar linkage</a>. If you make a linkage in the form of an orthodiagonal quadrilateral, and flex it, it will always stay orthodiagonal, even though its shape will change. Perhaps even more surprisingly, if you make a linkage in the form of a tangential quadrilateral, and flex it, it will always stay tangential!</p>

<p>Trick question: if you make a linkage in the form of a parallelogram, and flex it, will it always stay a parallelogram?</p>

<p>One way of explaining these facts is that the orthodiagonal and tangential quadrilaterals can both be characterized by similar-looking formulas in terms of the lengths <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, and <i>d</i> of their sides (in clockwise order). In an orthodiagonal quadrilateral, it follows from the Pythagorean theorem (applied to the four right triangles that the two diagonals split the quad into) that <nobr><i>a</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>c</i><sup>2</sup> = <i>b</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>d</i><sup>2</sup>,</nobr> and conversely any quadrilateral in which this is true must be orthodiagonal. Similarly, in a tangential quadrilateral, each triangle formed by one of the quadrilateral&#x27;s corners and the two adjacent points of tangency of the inscribed circle must be isosceles; it follows from this that <nobr><i>a</i> + <i>c</i> = <i>b</i> + <i>d</i>,</nobr> and conversely any quadrilateral in which this is true must be tangential. Since <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, and <i>d</i> don&#x27;t change when a four-bar linkage is flexed, these equations are invariant under flexing and orthodiagonality or tangentiality is preserved.</p>

<p>Another class of quadrilaterals that is invariant under flexing is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kite_(geometry)">kites</a>, quadrilaterals in which one of the diagonals is an axis of symmetry. A kite can be characterized by the two equations <nobr><i>a</i> = <i>b</i></nobr> and <nobr><i>c</i> = <i>d</i>.</nobr> However, a different pair of equations, <nobr><i>a</i> = <i>d</i></nobr> and <nobr><i>b</i> = <i>c</i>,</nobr> also defines a kite, with a different axis of symmetry. It turns out that the kites are exactly the quadrilaterals that are both orthodiagonal and tangential. In one direction, it&#x27;s obvious that if one of the two sets of kite equations is true, then the orthodiagonal and tangential equations are also true. In the other direction, a little algebra shows that if the orthodiagonal and tangential equations are both true, then <nobr>(<i>a</i> − <i>c</i>)<sup>2</sup> = (<i>b</i> − <i>d</i>)<sup>2</sup>.</nobr> If one takes square roots of both sides, there are two different cases to consider: the square roots can both have the same sign, or they can have opposite signs. In either case, one gets two linear equations in the four unknowns: the tangential quadrilateral equation and the equation from the square roots. Solving these simultaneous equations gives in the two different cases the two different sets of kite equations.</p>

<p>Ok, finally, the answer to the trick question: yes and no. Like a kite, a parallelogram is defined by two equal pairs of side lengths, but in a parallelogram the equal sides are opposite each other rather than adjacent. And most of the time when you flex a parallelogram it will remain a parallelogram. But if you stretch two opposite corners as far apart as possible (so that the edges of the parallelogram stretch to all lie on a single line) you can get from that configuration to a different configuration, with crossed edges, called an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiparallelogram">antiparallelogram</a>. So the class of parallelograms and antiparallelograms is closed under flexing, but parallelograms can turn into antiparallelograms or vice versa.</p>
