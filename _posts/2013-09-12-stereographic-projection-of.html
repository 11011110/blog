<p>This is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snub_cube">snub cube</a>, radially projected onto its circumscribing sphere and then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereographic_projection">stereographically projected</a> onto the plane. It's not quite a Lombardi drawing, because the angles of the quadrilateral faces are wider than the angles of the triangles. But I think it sets a good balance between optimizing the angular resolution around each vertex and preserving the property of the snub cube that, within each face, all the vertex angles are equal.</p>

<p>Do you know what are the three equations for the snub cube analogous to the <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/IcosahedralEquation.html">icosahedral equation</a>?</p>

<p>That's an equation for the coordinates of the points in the stereographic projection directly, right? But I used a different method for this drawing: <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/2013/stereographic-snub-cube.py">the code I used to draw</a> it constructs it in 3d, and then uses a general-purpose stereographic projection routine that would work for any set of points and great-circle arcs on the sphere.</p>

<p>The 3d vertex coordinates are permutations of \( (–1, \xi, 1/\xi) \), where
\[
\xi = \frac{(17 + 3\sqrt{33})^{1/3} - (-17 + 3\sqrt{33})^{1/3} – 1}{3}
\]
(a formula taken from the Wikipedia article).</p>

<p>Thank you for the response. Yes, that number is the reciprocal of the tribonacci constant. There is a nice continued fraction for it, by the way. Kindly see: http://sites.google.com/site/tpiezas/0012  P.S I find it amusing that the image for the guest post has a paper bag over the head.  :)   -- Tito</p>
