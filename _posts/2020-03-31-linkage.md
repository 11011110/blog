Still at home, hoping the coffee arrives tomorrow as scheduled. 

* [Science diagrams that look like shitposts](https://twitter.com/scienceshitpost) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/103834852903279134), [via](https://www.metafilter.com/186088/Science-diagrams-that-look-like-shitposts)).

* [All Cambridge University Press textbooks are free-to-read until May](https://www.cambridge.org/core/what-we-publish/textbooks) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@JordiGH/103841002082854377)).

* [Non-gray grayscales](https://www.rweber.net/projects/non-gray-grayscales/) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/103848490584549963)). Rebecca Weber finds a method to produce off-gray colors in a range of lightness with visually-matching hues and saturations. It's not just a matter of plotting a straight line in HSL colorspace. (Found while looking for more information on her book _Computability Theory_, but nowadays there isn't much actual math on her website.)

* [Convex hulls of random order types](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.08456) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/103853512504928724)). This is one of my favorite papers in the list accepted to SoCG 2020, which now will be online-only. Point sets whose order type is uniformly random are different from randomly drawn points, and harder to study. Xavier Goaoc and Emo Welzl observe that the projective transformations of a random order type are equally likely, and use this idea to prove that these point sets typically have very small convex hulls.

* [Greedy coloring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_coloring) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/103856462402785120)). Now a Good Article on Wikipedia.

* [The four points, two distances problem](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/oct/21/can-you-solve-it-the-four-points-two-distances-problem) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/103864906436854951)). Can you find all of the ways of arranging four distinct points in the plane so that they form only two distances? The link is not a spoiler but it has a separate link to the solution. "Nearly everyone misses at least one" says Peter Winkler; can you guess the one I missed?

* [Sariel Har-Peled makes some suggestions for online conferences](https://mastodon.social/@sarielhp/103853624792571796): all papers above threshold should be accepted, rather than imposing artificial acceptance rates, and authors should provide versions of their talks in multiple lengths.

* [Minimal-stick examples of the knots $$9_{35}$$, $$9_{39}$$, $$9_{43}$$, $$9_{45}$$, and $$9_{48}$$](https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/1904335) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@shonk/103868182994018206)).

* Two linocut interpretations of a rhombic dodecahedron by the same artist, Josh Millard: [abstract](https://mastodon.social/@joshmillard/103876129272051551) and [physical](https://mastodon.social/@joshmillard/103881150094999086) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/103887968806441789)).</span>

* Three recent "Did you know?" ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/103893665729668173)):

  * ... that [Chiara Daraio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiara_Daraio) used Newton's cradle to create sound bullets, and ball bearing filled walls to create one-way sound barriers? 

  * ... that [a tetrahedron with integer edge lengths, face areas, and volume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heronian_tetrahedron) can be given integer coordinates?

  * ... that former college basketball star [Amy Langville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Langville) is an expert in ranking systems, and has applied her ranking expertise to basketball bracketology? 

* [VisMath MathArt](http://www.mi.sanu.ac.rs/vismath/mart.htm) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/103898916402221482)). Many linked galleries of images of mathematical art, from the 1990s-style web (occasional broken links and all).

* [Sadly, graph theorist Robin Thomas has died](https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2020/03/robin-thomas.html) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/103901957462987629)).

* [What happens when half a cellular automaton runs Conway's Game of Life and the other half runs a rolling version of Rule 30 pushing chaos across the border](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK7nBOLYzdE) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/103915202241542224))? I wish I could see a larger scale of time and space to get an idea of how far the effects penetrate. If the boundary emitted gliders at a constant rate they'd collide far away in a form of ballistic annihilation but the boundary junk and glider-collision junk makes it more complicated.

* [Monotone subsets of uncountable plane sets](https://mathoverflow.net/q/356220/440) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/103919594138003386)). I ask on MathOverflow about infinite generalizations of the Erdős–Szekeres theorem on the existence of square-root-sized monotone subsets of finite sets of points in the plane.
