<p>I just created the following image of a pentagram for Wikipedia:</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/2008/Non-Desargues_configuration.svg" alt="Non-Desargues configuration: pentagram inscribed in another pentagram forming ten lines crossing in triples at ten points" /></p>

<p>It's a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_configuration">projective configuration</a> that has the same number of points, lines, and incidences as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desargues_configuration">Desargues configuration</a>, but is not equivalent to it. Michael Hardy found its description in an old forum posting.</p>

<p>If you look at the <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Non-Desargues_configuration.svg">source code</a> I used to draw it, you'll see that it uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neusis_construction">neusis</a>, or the modern equivalent, binary search, to find the appropriate scale of the outside pentagram relative to the inside one so that the points all line up. (You'll also see that I don't comment heavily when I write quick one-off code like this, but I hope it's short enough to be readable anyway.) Is this figure drawable with compass and unmarked straightedge alone?</p>

<p><i>(Hint: what kind of function is the binary search finding the root of?)</i></p>

Sweet.  Kinda random.  All kinds of interesting analyses can be done on reference sites like Wikipedia.  Personally, I also like to check out About.com and Site605 (http://www.site605.com) - there are a few other reference sites that I think will give Wikipedia a run for their money.

I'm curious, what software do you use to generate your diagrams for these journal posts?

Usually Adobe Illustrator (and I did use Illustrator to generate the png format for this one) but in this case it was primarily a custom Python program, using the pyx package to generate the graphics. You can see the program itself by following the source link in the post.
