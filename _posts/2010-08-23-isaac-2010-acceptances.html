<p>The <a href="http://tclab.kaist.ac.kr/~isaac10/accepted.html">list of accepted papers</a> to ISAAC 2010 (in December in Korea) is online, and it also includes abstracts. I've already described the preprint versions of my two contributed papers, on <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/2010/07/11/one-crossing-minor-free-flows.html">flows in minor-free graphs</a> and <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/2010/06/28/listing-maximal-cliques.html">clique-finding</a>, so instead I'll mention a few of the other abstracts that intrigued me:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Senot, Durand-Lose, and Duchier report on a graphical technical for solving NP-hard SAT problems by drawing lines in the plane, which (they say) can be viewed as a kind of massively parallel algorithm.</p></li>
<li><p>Farzan, Gagie, and Navarro describe data structures for storing a compressed representation of a set of points in the plane, with total space only a small amount above the entropy of the set, that can nevertheless perform many standard range querying tasks quickly.</p></li>
<li><p>Limouzy introduces a new type of graph minor concept involving complementation of the edges around a vertex, shows that it preserves cographs and modular decompositions, and uses it to find a forbidden graph characterization of permutation graphs.</p></li>
<li><p>Di Giacomo, Didimo, Liotta, and Meijer investigate drawings of trees that are neary Euclidean minimum spanning trees of their vertices, in the sense that each edge in the drawing is at most a small factor larger than the longest edge in the EMST path connecting the same two vertices. Although most trees cannot be drawn as exact EMSTs, all trees have nearly-EMST drawings in this sense.</p></li>
<li><p>Adiga, Chitnis, and Saurabh find efficient FPT algorithms for computing the boxicity of a graph (the minimimum dimension of a representation as an intersection graph of boxes), when parametrized by vertex cover number.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>There were many other interesting looking abstracts as well, so I think it should be a good conference.</p>

Typo: the name of first author of second paper is Farzan.

Oops, fixed. Thanks for the correction, and my apologies to Farzan.

Gah. I need to copyedit my posts better, obviously. Thanks for the second correction.
