* You're probably familiar with machine-learning-based translation between natural languages, based on finding patterns in large datasets of known translations, for instance as used by Google translate. Now the Xena people are trying to use the same methods to [convert LaTeX-formatted natural-language descriptions of mathematical propositions into the formal language used by the Lean theorem prover](https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2022/08/16/the-future-of-interactive-theorem-proving/) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/108834522515462270)).</span>

* [Many minimal triangulations of "manifolds like the octonionic projective plane"](https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2022/08/19/alexander-a-gaifullin-many-27-vertex-triangulations-of-manifolds-like-the-octonionic-projective-plane-not-even-one-was-known-before/) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/108854003041559158)).</span> Blog post by Gil Kalai based on [a new preprint by Alexander Gaifullin](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08507). Gaifullin conjectures that these all are the octonionic projective plane (not merely "like it"). Gil's post connects this to several other extremal problems, mostly in polyhedral combinatorics but also including the existence of a girth-5 degree-57 [Moore graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_graph).

No explanation why yet, but I suspect it's not because of falsified experimental data.

* Today's simple and somewhat obvious geometry observation <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/108865083323085368)),</span> made while trying to fit old CD cover art into sleeves of a CD binder for more compact storage: if you're trying to fit a flexible sheet into a flexible sleeve that is only just barely big enough to hold it, it doesn't help to bend both into a convex curve; they will still be too tight. Instead, if you bend the sheet into a compound curve, while letting the sleeve fall into a convex shape surrounding it, you can make more room.

I would have also tried Le Génie but it was closed mornings. The best coffee was at Hailed, but it's tiny, with only outdoor seating. Second-best coffee, and the best space to hang out to drink the coffee, was Mast. The others did not disappoint but were not as good as Hailed and Mast.

* [The toxic culture of rejection in computer science](https://sigbed.org/2022/08/22/the-toxic-culture-of-rejection-in-computer-science/) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/108910723093352198),</span> [via](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32605494)), Edward Lee in the ACM SIGBED blog. I disagree with the post's preference for incrementalism over novelty, but I agree that there's big price for being too selective. Beyond frustrating everyone, I think it leads to dominance of trendiness and in-groups over significance, progress, originality, and depth. And though that may be good for those in the trendy in-groups, it's not good for the field.
