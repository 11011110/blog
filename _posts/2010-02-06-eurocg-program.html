It&#x27;s still a week or two until we can expect to see the SoCG acceptances, but in the meantime there&#x27;s another set of computational geometry titles out: <a href="http://2010.eurocg.org/accepted_papers.shtml">the EuroCG accepted papers</a>. Like the fall workshops in the U.S., EuroCG doesn&#x27;t have a full proceedings, freeing the participants to announce their best recent work there without preempting the possibility of publishing it elsewhere. This year it&#x27;s in Dortmund, Germany, from March 22 to 24, and registration is open at the <a href="http://2010.eurocg.org/">workshop&#x27;s web site</a>.

My vote for most intriguing title: &quot;How Alexander the Great Brought the Greeks Together while Inflicting Minimal Damage to the Barbarians&quot;, by Mark de Berg, Dirk Gerrits, Amirali Khosravi, Ignaz Rutter, Constantinos Tsirogiannis and Alexander Wolff.
