<p>It's still a week or two until we can expect to see the SoCG acceptances, but in the meantime there's another set of computational geometry titles out: <a href="http://2010.eurocg.org/accepted_papers.shtml">the EuroCG accepted papers</a>. Like the fall workshops in the U.S., EuroCG doesn't have a full proceedings, freeing the participants to announce their best recent work there without preempting the possibility of publishing it elsewhere. This year it's in Dortmund, Germany, from March 22 to 24, and registration is open at the <a href="http://2010.eurocg.org/">workshop's web site</a>.</p>

<p>My vote for most intriguing title: "How Alexander the Great Brought the Greeks Together while Inflicting Minimal Damage to the Barbarians", by Mark de Berg, Dirk Gerrits, Amirali Khosravi, Ignaz Rutter, Constantinos Tsirogiannis and Alexander Wolff.</p>
