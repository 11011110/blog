<p>The official opening day of softball last Saturday was rained out, so my daughter&#x27;s team had its first game last night. I always enjoy shooting evening games â€” the light is difficult to work with, but looks very pretty just before the sunset and again once it starts getting dark. And we started on an up note, with an 8-7 win. <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/riptide/cp/">Full gallery here</a>.</p>
