<p>I just ran across a new journal, <a href="http://www.oldcitypublishing.com/IJUC/IJUC.html">The International Journal of Unconventional Computing</a>, with four issues published so far.  As is not so unusual these days, its papers are available free online.  Unfortunately, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/2005/09/02/rss-feeds-for.html">like too many online paper repositories</a>, it appears to have no RSS feed.</p>

<p>Of most interest to me: <a href="http://www.oldcitypublishing.com/FullText/IJUCfulltext/IJUC1.4fulltext/WUENSCHE.pdf">Glider Dynamics in 3-Value Hexagonal Cellular Automata: The Beehive Rule</a> which describes some simple CA rules with complex behavior.  I must admit, though, that I'm a little put out at their statement that, among known binary CA rules, Life "appears to be somewhat unique" in its glider dynamics, since <a href="http://fano.ics.uci.edu/ca/">my CA glider database</a> shows that Life is very far from being "somewhat unique" in this respect.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.oldcitypublishing.com/IJUC/IJUC%201.3%20contents.html">special issue on artificial immune systems</a> may also have some interest to security researchers, or it may just be blue sky, it's hard for me to tell.</p>

Sure, go ahead.  And no need to be quite so formal...
