* [Sophie Schmieg's post-quantum crypto work acquires a crank who thinks he's "created the first software only true random number generator"](https://infosec.exchange/@sophieschmieg/113766379943919089). Schmieg heads the ISE Crypto team at Google. It's not clear to me exactly which blog post led to this, but her blog at [Key Material](https://keymaterial.net/author/sophieschmieg/) has several interesting posts on post-quantum crypto and signature schemes.

![A carved yellow stone cat with a carved jacket and leaf hat sits in a buddha pose, front paws folded across its large round belly, in a garden with purple flowers, moss, bark chips, and some tufts of grass. In front of the cat is a large mossy square concrete paving tile patterned with Escher-like interlocked flying birds. A steel pole rises on the right edge of the image, next to the cat; its shadow cuts crisply across the paving tile like the gnomon of a sundial. Out of frame, the pole supports a bird feeder. Some small pebbles, smoothed round, sit at the cat's feet near the corner of the tile.](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/buddhacat/buddhacat-m.jpg){: style="border-style:solid;border-color:black" }

  $$\sum_{k=1}^n k^3 = \left(\sum_{k=1}^n k\right)^2$$

  might really be counting, with nice pictures of 4-dimensional stacks of cannon balls.

Relatedly, @QuantaMagazine@mstdn.social hasn't posted since June 2023, and @quanta_bot@social.platypush.tech hasn't posted since November 2022. Is _Quanta_ actually federated anywhere currently?

My go-to alternatives are [MathSciNet](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/)/[zbMATH](https://zbmath.org/) for mathematics, [DBLP](https://dblp.org/) for computer science, and [a command-line invocation of curl](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/500222/retrieve-bibliographic-data-from-doi-code-using-command-line) for anything with a doi.

It's even possible to simulate some simple algorithms step-by-step and expand the form after each step: see for instance [an example of this for the Euclidean algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm#Procedure).
