<p>I recently expanded the Wikipedia article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadget_(computer_science)">gadgets</a>, the basic building blocks of most NP-completeness proofs, after its previous poor state led another editor to try to get it deleted.</p>

<p>While doing so, I discovered that we didn't already have an article on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berman%E2%80%93Hartmanis_conjecture">Bermanâ€“Hartmanis conjecture</a> according to which every two NP-complete problems should be related by a polynomial-time isomorphism, so I wrote one. Supposedly nobody believes this any more but despite that there are recent papers such as <a href="http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/manindra/isomorphism/easy-cylinder-conjecture.pdf">Agrawal and Watanabe CCC 2009</a> that seem to be more positive than negative.</p>

<p>I'm not a complexity theorist, so it's entirely likely that I've misunderstood some of the sources. If so, please correct me.</p>

<p>Very nice! Gadgets are one of the main tools in the TCS toolbox, and thus a major conceptual contribution. Good to see them described <i>per se</i>.</p>
