Here&#x27;s a cute little geometric factoid that has something to do with one of the posts over at the <a href="http://www.walkingrandomly.com/?p=109">33rd Carnival of Mathematics</a>. I&#x27;ll leave it as a puzzle which post it belongs to...
<br />

<br />
Let ABC be any triangle in the Euclidean plane, and AD be any line. Form points A&#x27;, B&#x27;, and C&#x27; as the perpendicular projections of A onto BC, B onto AD, and C onto AD respectively. Then triangles ABC and A&#x27;B&#x27;C&#x27; are similar.

(Hint: in the post I have in mind, ABC is isosceles and A&#x27; is the midpoint of BC.)
