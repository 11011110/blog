* Congratulations to Rajeev Alur of the the University of Pennsylvania for [winning the 2024 Knuth Prize](https://www.sigact.org/prizes/knuth/citation2024.html) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/112970262010444370)),</span> "for his introduction of novel models of computation which provide the theoretical foundations for analysis, design, synthesis, and verification of computer systems"!

* Boxed cat heads: <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/112975837957399963)).</span>

* [New OEIS sequence](https://oeis.org/A375492) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/112980759698287845)):</span> 1, 1, 2, 2, 5, 5, 10, 10, 26, 26, 52, 52, 130, 130, 260, 260, 677, 677, ... If you want a puzzle you can try guessing what it means before clicking through. For a bigger puzzle (one I don't have an answer to): is there a natural meaning (other than the trivial $$a(2n)$$) for the sequence 1, 2, 5, 10, 26, ... that you get by removing the duplicates?

* [The Chronicle of Higher Education on the consequences of MIT dropping race as an admissions criterion](https://www.chronicle.com/article/after-ban-on-race-conscious-admissions-mits-black-and-latino-enrollment-plunges) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/113003040828033888)).</span> It frames the story as "Black and Latino Enrollment Plunges", which I think we can all agree is bad. But buried in the article text one finds "Asian American students account for almost half, or 47 percent, of the incoming class, an increase of six percentage points over their share from 2020 to 2023. White enrollment stayed almost unchanged."

  My conclusion is the same as when affirmative action was banned in California in 1996: affirmative action, as implemented, never took positions from white students to give to minorities. Instead, it was done at the expense of other minorities not considered disadvantaged, today and then Asian Americans. (In an earlier time it might have been Jews.) When race-based admission is banned, and with it both affirmative action for disadvantaged minorities and suppression of not-considered-disadvantaged minorities, the suppression is lifted and we see from the difference how much they were suppressed.

  The structural oppression faced by the disadvantaged minorities, causing them to be less competitive as applicants, remains. If we can no longer counterbalance it with affirmative action, we need some other way to reduce its effects. A common proxy for race is to let applicants offer hard-luck stories and give spots to those whose story is the most convincing. This plausibly has the advantage of targeting the people most affected by structural oppression, but I don't have data or links on how effectively it works.
