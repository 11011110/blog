If you mean that the Times article link was broken, I replaced it with a more up-to-date link just now. But it won&#x27;t lead to the full article unless you pay or have a subscription...

ok so the link is http://cranitorium.com/aneurysm/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=20&amp;Itemid=50 now that is the best one i found that could be used by the kid in the movie so true to story that one seems to be the best to me, i made one out of soft wood because i failed to read the whole hard wood information, mine works and i see nothing wrong with it...if u are interested in getting the picture in the middle of the locket as in the movie, its much harder there is a guy who figured it out on youtube, he hasn&#x27;t said how but it has to do with the free rotation of the picture
