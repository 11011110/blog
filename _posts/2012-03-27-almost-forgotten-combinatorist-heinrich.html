<p>At the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th, combinatorics flourished in German mathematics research, under the leadership of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Hindenburg">Carl Hindenburg</a>. Later opinion has not been kind:</p>

<blockquote><p><i>&quot;ill-advised and purposeless modification&quot;</i> — <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=mxgPAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA55">Sir Thomas Muir 1906</a></p>

<p><i>&quot;of limited scope and restricted application&quot;</i> — <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=L0UbAQAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA752">Encyclopaedia Brittanica 1910</a></p>

<p><i>&quot;mired in the mathematical trivia by which the School itself was plagued&quot;</i> — <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00327297">Manning 1975</a></p>

<p><i>&quot;The faults of his [Euler&#x27;s] time found their culmination in the Combinatorial School in Germany, which has now passed into oblivion&quot;</i> — <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=mGJRjIC9fZgC&pg=PA373">Cajori 1991</a></p>

<p><i>&quot;thousands of pages filled with esoteric symbolism that must have impressed many nonmathematicians&quot;</i> — <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=56LNfE2QGtYC&pg=PA70">Knuth 2006</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Knuth goes on to call <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_August_Rothe">Heinrich August Rothe</a> &quot;Hindenberg&#x27;s best student&quot;, and says that his work is &quot;not completely trivial&quot;, but cites as evidence only an algorithm for finding the successor and predecessor of a morse code sequence in lexicographic order.</p>

<p>Here are some Rothe&#x27;s other contributions, from just one of his publications:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first definition of the inverse of a permutation</li>
<li>A proof that the number of inversions of a permutation (the concept that Muir called &quot;ill-advised and purposeless&quot;) is the same as for its inverse</li>
<li>A proof that the determinant of a matrix is the same as for its transpose</li>
<li>A diagram (the Rothe diagram) still used for visualization of permutations and inversions</li>
<li>The first definition of a self-inverse permutation</li>
<li>A simple recurrence formula for the <a href="http://oeis.org/A000085">number of self-inverse permutations</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Not completely trivial?!</p>

<p>Yes, these results are easy nowadays, but in part that&#x27;s because we learn about permutations from our beginning years of college, if not earlier. And where did what we learn about come from?</p>
