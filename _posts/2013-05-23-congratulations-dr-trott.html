<p>Lowell Trott, one of the theory students here at UCI, successfully defended his thesis yesterday. Lowell's Ph.D. advisor is Mike Goodrich, but I've also <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/a-trott">worked with him</a> on several publications related to both social networks and road networks. (Although the vertices in road networks are not people, the networks still come from a social structure.) Specifically, he:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.2891">Showed that road networks have the property that any line of sight crosses only a small number of roads</a>, both empirically and in a mathematical model of these networks based on circle packings;</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.0783">Developed data structures for taking a census of different kinds of small subgraphs in a social network</a>, with efficiency bounded by a parameter that is small for real-world networks;</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1108.4675">Showed how greedy routing can be used by actors in a social network</a> using estimates of the distance to a destination based on shared characteristics rather than geometric coordinates; and</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.0748">Used gravitational forces to move the more important vertices in a social network towards the center of its drawing</a>, also providing more compact graph layouts that allow the size of individual features to be larger relative to the overall layout area.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>My understanding is that he has accepted a position at Google, starting in the fall. Congratulations, Lowell!</p>

Thank you for sharing it through arxiv! These papers look quite interesting! I am especially eager to read the first one, with an application to the US roads. :)
