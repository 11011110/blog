Today&#x27;s new Wikipedia articles: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanner_polytope">Hanner polytopes</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalai%27s_3%5Ed_conjecture">Kalai&#x27;s 3<sup><i>d</i></sup> conjecture</a>.
<br />

<br />
The 3<sup><i>d</i></sup> conjecture states that a centrally symmetric <i>d</i>-dimensional polytope must have at least 3<sup><i>d</i></sup> faces (of all dimensions including the <i>d</i>-dimensional polytope itself as a face but not including the â€“1-dimensional empty set). For instance, the cube has 8 vertices, 12 edges, 6 squares, and 1 cube as faces; <nobr>8 + 12 + 6 + 1 = 27 = 3<sup>3</sup></nobr>.
<br />

<br />
The Hanner polytopes include the cubes, are closed under Cartesian products and duality, and if the conjecture is true have the fewest possible numbers of faces of all centrally symmetric <i>d</i>-dimensional polytopes. They also have some other interesting properties. In 3d there are only the cube and the octahedron, but in higher dimensions there are a lot more of them.
