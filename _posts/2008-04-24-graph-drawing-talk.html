<p>I spoke today about graph drawing at a seminar in our School of Social Sciences. They're very mathematically sophisticated over there (and more interested in combinatorics than our mathematicians are) but it was still mostly not a very technical talk â€” I just showed lots of pretty pictures and used them to motivate some thoughts about how I think graph drawing should be done. <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/IMBS-graph-drawing-talk.pdf">Slides here</a>.</p>

<p>Early in the talk, I included a bit of an ad for the annual graph drawing conference, so let me do that here too. Graph drawing! Crete! September! The submission deadline is May 31, and the call for papers may be found at <a href="http://www.gd2008.org/">http://www.gd2008.org/</a>.</p>
