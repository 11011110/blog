I&#x27;m back in Manhattan for a meeting at Columbia yesterday and today. The campus doesn&#x27;t seem to have changed very much, physically at least, since I was here in 1989. I&#x27;m happy enough not to be living in the city, but I feel like I should visit here more often â€” I enjoy it when I do, it feels very familiar and comfortable.
