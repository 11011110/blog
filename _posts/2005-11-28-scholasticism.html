Michael O&#x27;Hare has a great essay up on <a href="http://www.markarkleiman.com/archives/teaching_/2005/11/science_and_faith.php">science and faith</a>: basically, that the popular view of science is largely as a collection of facts to be memorized instead of a lens through which to see the world, and how this attitude hurts both science itself and any efforts towards a reality-based public policy decision process.

True dat - but it&#x27;s by no means a new problem. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345409469/102-0131903-8249759?v=glance&n=283155&v=glance">The Demon-Haunted World</a> addresses this problem as well.
