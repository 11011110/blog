The <a href="http://rigtriv.wordpress.com/2008/07/11/carnival-of-mathematics/">36th Carnival of Mathematics</a> is now up at Rigorous Trivialities.
<br />

<br />
In my RSS newsreader, I have so many different math/theory blogs listed that I&#x27;ve had to group them into categories â€” the ones by algorithms researchers, the ones about visualization, the ones using category theory, the ones more about politics than mathematics... (and now that I write this down here, it&#x27;s starting to sound like <a href="http://www.multicians.org/thvv/borges-animals.html">Borges&#x27; encyclopedia</a>). Anyway, I have only a half dozen or so grouped under &quot;mathematics is serious business&quot; and rigtriv is one of them. He&#x27;s worked hard to inject some serious research mathematics into a carnival that is often too heavy on the side of elementary material (much as I may like such material myself), and found some interesting posts to link to, so go read.
