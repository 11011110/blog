<p>Harvard theoretical computer scientist Michael Mitzenmacher has <a href="http://www.mybiasedcoin.blogspot.com/">a new blog</a>.</p>

<p>Michael writes "The main thrust that I hope will differentiate this blog from others is that it will focus on the convergence of algorithms (or, more generally, "CS theory"), information theory, and networks." But I think one could stop at the word "focus" and already differentiate it from some of the rest of ours...</p>

<p>More TCS bloggers can only be a good thing, I think, both for increased communication within the field and for outreach to the rest of the world. And though there hasn't yet been enough time for much technical content to appear, he does already have an interesting post on <a href="http://mybiasedcoin.blogspot.com/2007/06/best-papers-for-theorynetworking-class.html">suggested reading lists for algorithmic networking</a>.</p>
