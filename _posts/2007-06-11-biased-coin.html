Harvard theoretical computer scientist Michael Mitzenmacher has <a href="http://www.mybiasedcoin.blogspot.com/">a new blog</a>.
<br />

<br />
Michael writes &quot;The main thrust that I hope will differentiate this blog from others is that it will focus on the convergence of algorithms (or, more generally, &quot;CS theory&quot;), information theory, and networks.&quot; But I think one could stop at the word &quot;focus&quot; and already differentiate it from some of the rest of ours...
<br />

More TCS bloggers can only be a good thing, I think, both for increased communication within the field and for outreach to the rest of the world. And though there hasn&#x27;t yet been enough time for much technical content to appear, he does already have an interesting post on <a href="http://mybiasedcoin.blogspot.com/2007/06/best-papers-for-theorynetworking-class.html">suggested reading lists for algorithmic networking</a>.
