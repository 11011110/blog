<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_graph">Gray Graph</a> is the subgraph of a nine-dimensional hypercube induced by the bitvectors that have the form \( \{000,001,010,100\}^3 \) and that have at least two nonzero bits. I was excited this afternoon thinking that this embedding would give a second nonplanar <a href="http://www.combinatorics.org/Volume_13/Abstracts/v13i1r79.html">cubic partial cube</a> (the only known one being the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desargues_graph">Desargues Graph</a>), but unfortunately it doesn't: e.g. \( 001001000 \) and \( 001010000 \) are at distance four in the graph via a path \( 001001000 - 001001001 - 001000001 - 001010001 - 001010000 \), but they have Hamming distance only two. In fact the graph is not a partial cube for any  hypercube embedding. I guess that means it does provide another natural example of a hypercube subgraph that's <a href="{{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2006-09-25-induced-but-not %}">induced but not isometric</a>...</p>
