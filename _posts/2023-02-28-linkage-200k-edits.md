* [Executive Order on Further Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through The Federal Government](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/02/16/executive-order-on-further-advancing-racial-equity-and-support-for-underserved-communities-through-the-federal-government/) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@sorelle@mastodon.social/109875326202971711)),</span> including guidelines for equitable use of AI and automated systems through a new [Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights](https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/) (that is, rights for people to be protected against unfair uses of AI, not rights for artificial intelligences).

* [Why prove it?](https://press.princeton.edu/ideas/why-prove-it) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@highergeometer/109854745668334423),</span> [via](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=13288)). John Stillwell on human-written vs machine-checkable proofs, with reference to the abc conjecture.

* [Low tide at Crystal Cove State Park](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/ltcc/index.html) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/109894403539276698)).</span>

* Another newly promoted Wikipedia Good Article: [Polygonalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygonalization) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/109906715996859674)),</span> about finding a polygon that uses all of a given set of points as vertices. The usual definitions allow it to go straight through some of the vertices, rather than always turning, though, and the illustration below shows why: for some point sets, including 3x3 grids, a polygon that turns everywhere might not exist.

* [Would it be possible to create a tool to automatically diagram papers?](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2023/02/18/would-it-be-possible-to-create-a-tool-to-automatically-diagram-papers/) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/109887019658810502)),</span> by Terry Tao, inspired by the diagrams the proof-assistant people have been using to guide their work.

* People who indulge in the fringe belief in the reality of certain folklore beasts are sad that [Wikipedia now focuses on the folklore of these beasts without going into much detail about the fringe belief in their reality](https://boingboing.net/2023/02/22/the-cryptid-complications-of-wikipedias-editing-policies.html) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/109918360457067075)).</span> (Based on a both-sides-ist _Slate_ article that I'm not going to link.)

* [Origami actuators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDhT6-6Yr_I) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@logicalelegance@mastodon.online/109920746034435458)),</span> for simple repetitive motions of origami models, by attaching flat-printed electromagnets to them.

*  Gasarch writes: [It is more important than ever to teach your students probability (even non-stem students)](https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2023/02/it-is-more-important-than-ever-to-teach.html) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/109935523877122235)).</span> Why: because your university may be making deals promoting online gambling to the same students, as the linked copy of a New York Times article details.

* [Sometime in the last month (not exactly sure when) I passed the milestone of 200,000 edits (all non-automated) to Wikipedia](https://xtools.wmflabs.org/ec/en.wikipedia.org/David_Eppstein) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/109941265893054592)).</span> That's...a lot of edits. Although, as of earlier in the month when it was below 200,000, it only places me at 260 on the [list of all-time prolific editors](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:List_of_Wikipedians_by_number_of_edits&oldid=1138516223). And a couple of the top ten are now blocked, so it's not exactly always a place of pride.

* [Mesmerizing paper sculptures and animations by Zai Divecha convey the subtlety of change](https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2023/02/zai-divecha-phase-shift/) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@colossal@mastodon.art/109937307601608046),</span> [see also](https://zaidivecha.com/)). Basically a 3d papercraft zoetrope.
