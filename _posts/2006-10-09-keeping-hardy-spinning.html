If there are infinitely many Mersenne primes, <a href="http://eccc.hpi-web.de/eccc-reports/2006/TR06-127/index.html">more efficient error-correcting codes exist</a> for problems in which only a few bits of a message need to be recovered, given a high transmission error rate. Even finitely many additional such primes would improve the length of these codes; this kind of coding has applications in both cryptography and the theory of approximation algorithms. And you probably thought (as did I) that <a href="http://www.mersenne.org/">all the computational effort devoted to the search for Mersenne primes</a> was purely an exercise in recreational math...

That&#x27;s quite amazing.

The guy was in the cubicle next to mine this summer. There&#x27;s some people who you interact with and you know right away that they&#x27;re so insanely smart they&#x27;re in a whole different league; you can never hope to be like them, but you can only watch in awe and cheer them on.
