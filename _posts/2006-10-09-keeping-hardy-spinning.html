<p>If there are infinitely many Mersenne primes, <a href="http://eccc.hpi-web.de/eccc-reports/2006/TR06-127/index.html">more efficient error-correcting codes exist</a> for problems in which only a few bits of a message need to be recovered, given a high transmission error rate. Even finitely many additional such primes would improve the length of these codes; this kind of coding has applications in both cryptography and the theory of approximation algorithms. And you probably thought (as did I) that <a href="http://www.mersenne.org/">all the computational effort devoted to the search for Mersenne primes</a> was purely an exercise in recreational math...</p>

<p>That's quite amazing.</p>

<p>The guy was in the cubicle next to mine this summer. There's some people who you interact with and you know right away that they're so insanely smart they're in a whole different league; you can never hope to be like them, but you can only watch in awe and cheer them on.</p>
