<p>I'm in Mendocino once more for their July 4th parade. As usual it was an irreverent mixture of fire trucks, local businesses and politicians, theatre troupes, hippies, and protesters in a beautiful oceanside setting. Lots of fun, and I took <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/j4p15/index.html">lots of photos</a>. Here's just one shot, of the start of the parade, where all the local fire departments (mostly volunteers) bring their trucks and set off their sirens.</p>

<p>The fog bank visible in the background is not a good omen for the success of tonight's fireworks show...</p>
