I&#x27;m in Mendocino once more for their July 4th parade. As usual it was an irreverent mixture of fire trucks, local businesses and politicians, theatre troupes, hippies, and protesters in a beautiful oceanside setting. Lots of fun, and I took <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/j4p15/index.html">lots of photos</a>. Here&#x27;s just one shot, of the start of the parade, where all the local fire departments (mostly volunteers) bring their trucks and set off their sirens.

The fog bank visible in the background is not a good omen for the success of tonight&#x27;s fireworks show...
