* [AI researchers shun _Nature Machine Intelligence_](https://boingboing.net/2018/05/01/public-sphere-v-elsevier.html) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/R4cUhmJYYCt)). Apparently it's not a good time to launch a closed journal in a field where "virtually all of the major outlets make no charge for access to or publication of papers".

* [Why I won't be using Adobe Scan](https://www.ghacks.net/2017/06/02/why-i-wont-be-using-adobe-scan/) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/U2NGr42aQ4z)). As Martin Brinkmann writes, "I won't use an application that forces registration and cloud saving on me." Well, I kind of do with my email, but the fewer other corporations that I give copies of my scanned documents the better.

* [Why I write about women on Wikipedia](https://blog.wikimedia.org/2018/05/03/why-i-women-wikipedia/) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/3qRwuHCiLes)). Editor SusunW discusses her motivation for contributing to women's biographies on Wikipedia.

* [The Golomb graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golomb_graph) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/3nDNhCFW3nv)). It's mostly famous as a (nonplanarly-drawn) unit distance graph, but it's also polyhedral. In the G+ comments, I challenge my readers to find drawings of it as a convex polyhedron. My favorite is Greg Egan's rotating version using only equilateral and isosceles triangles and regular pentagons (below), but Refurio Anachro's almost-convex unit distance representation of the dual (a tetrahedron glued onto a [triangular cupola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_cupola)) is also nice.

* [_Forbidden Configurations in Discrete Geometry_](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/forbidden-configurations-in-discrete-geometry/0A90D6B522B1DFF59641F086F149EA45) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/RM1UhNUBL66)). My new book exists! Or at least, you can get the e-reader version. Be careful if you have a black-and-white Kindle, as I do: it has lots of color illustrations. The print version will come later this year. [Here's my department's news item about it](http://www.cs.uci.edu/eppstein-publishes-new-book-forbidden-patterns-in-discrete-geometry-for-mathematicians-and-computer-scientists/).

* [Wiki Editing Day](http://aperiodical.com/2018/05/how-to-join-in-with-our-distributed-wiki-edit-day/) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/3Gm1WBtL7Jv), [via](https://plus.google.com/+Aperiodical/posts/c4c3JNAwRxy)). An online project to improve Wikipedia's coverage related to female mathematicians, now past.

* [Dear Autocorrect... (Sincerely, Mathematician)](http://www.math3ma.com/mathema/2017/8/21/dear-autocorrect) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/CSUN1QTLkHJ)). From [math3ma](http://www.math3ma.com/), the blog of mathematics graduate student Tai-Danae Bradley (most other posts of which are in large part about category theory).

* [Katara constructs finite projective planes](https://blog.plover.com/math/finite-projective-planes.html) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/SZSRG8UZHau)). An amusing application of finite geometry to children's games.

* [London Combinatorics Colloquia](https://cameroncounts.wordpress.com/2018/05/11/london-combinatorics-colloquia-3/) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/6KDK15AUwGb)). Peter Cameron summarizes a collection of interesting sounding combinatorics talks: János Pach on triangling the triangle, Carsten Thomassen on nowhere-zero flows, Paul Russell on additive combinatorics, Katherine Staden on induced Turán theorems, Agelos Georgakopoulos on percolation, and Nikhil Bansal on discrepancy.

* [Shape of Light: 100 Years of Photography and Abstract Art](http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/shape-light) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/6zYQH891AzQ), [via](http://www.artlyst.com/previews/shape-of-light-photographys-relationship-with-abstract-art-tate-modern/)). Unfortunately I don't think I'll be in London any time between now and the October close of this exhibit at the Tate Modern on the relation between photography and abstract art. But if I were it would be high on my priorities to see.

* [Tiling Bot](https://twitter.com/tilingbot) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/85UgbaQvg1Q), [via](https://plus.google.com/+RoiceNelson/posts/1NuGBzMwzW7), [also via](http://linescurvesspirals.blogspot.co.uk/2018/05/carnival-of-mathematics-157.html)). A pretty tiling on twitter, daily.

* [Maria Agnesi, the greatest female mathematician you’ve never heard of](https://theconversation.com/maria-agnesi-the-greatest-female-mathematician-youve-never-heard-of-94378) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/JbGmXUuNf9w)). Possibly the author underestimates how much we've heard of her and her [witch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch_of_Agnesi), but it's a nice piece anyway.
