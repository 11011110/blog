<p>As <a href="{{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2014-02-28-pythagorean-associativity %}">I promised earlier</a>, here is the video for my talk on "structures in solution spaces" at the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2014-03-01-meaningfulness %}">Conference on Meaningfulness and Learning Spaces</a> last February.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><iframe style="border:none;" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fVNrVR0OvAM" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>It was a wide-ranging talk, about learning spaces, distributive lattices and Birkhoff's representation theorem for them, rectangular cartograms, antimatroids, the 1/3-2/3 conjecture for partial orders and antimatroids, partial cubes, and flip distance in binary trees and point sets. It was also about an hour long, so don't watch unless you have the time. For those with shorter attention spans, I've also put up a pdf file of <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/Epp-IMBS-14.pdf">my talk slides</a>.</p>

For those who like me are interested in discrete mathematics and discrete algorithms, Fred Roberts' talk on when the output of an algorithm is meaningful and Jean-Paul Doignon's talk on polyhedral combinatorics might be particularly interesting.</p>
