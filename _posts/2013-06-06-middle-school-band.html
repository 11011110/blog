I recently had my camera cleaned, and forgot to set it to shooting in raw mode when it came back reset to its factory settings. So <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/hatconcert/">the photos I shot this evening of my son&#x27;s band concert</a> are all pretty much as they came from the camera, with only minor noise and contrast tweaks. Fortunately despite the poor lighting the camera came through with reasonable choices of exposure and color.
