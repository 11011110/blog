* [Hedra Zoo](https://sforcey.github.io/sf34/hedra.htm) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/109794057137669490)),</span> like the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, but for sequences of polyhedra rather than sequences of integers.

* [Mathematical 3d prints by Dan Piker](https://mathstodon.xyz/@Danpiker/109773012543776299): Morin's surface, Boy's surface, a Klein bottle, and a puzzle based on a 3d Pythagorean tiling.

* [Origami tessellation torus](https://www.flickr.com/photos/tactom/8471902275/) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@monsoon0/109800312114130835)),</span> by Tomohiro Tachi.

* [Low crossing numbers](https://discrete-notes.github.io/crossing-number) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/109810071945968761)),</span> blog post on [a SoCG 21 paper by Mónika Csikós and Nabil H. Mustafa](https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.SoCG.2021.28). Given points and a family of shapes containing subsets of them, the goal is to connect the points by a matching, path, or spanning tree so that no shape has its boundary crossed by many edges. Many geometric set families have these structures and this paper shows how to find it faster than was previously known.

* [Quoridor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quoridor) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/109815696566120005)),</span> a game with simple abstract rules that lead to an interesting mix of strategy and tactics, in which you often have to balance the future effects of a move on your own progress versus its effects on your opponent.

* [Knotty analog oscilloscope art](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lthHMDXbP30) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@henryseg/109809898659918995)),</span> video by Henry Segerman with Matthias Goerner.

* It's not every day that I (and many other Mathstodon users) [get mentioned in the _New York Times_](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/07/science/puzzles-rectangles-mathematics.html) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@phonner/109826175739500354))!</span> The context is an article by Siobhan Roberts on partitioning rectangles into similar rectangles.

* [The list of accepted papers at SoCG'23](https://cs.utdallas.edu/SOCG23/socg.html) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/109830669758019190)),</span> the 39th International Symposium on Computational Geometry, next June in Dallas, is now online. I have one in the list; I'll post in more detail on it once I have a preprint version ready. [One of my earlier posts]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2022-09-21-counting-paths-convex %}) is related and [another post]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2022-08-22-permuted-points-interest %}) was a lemma that I ended up not using.

* [Beware the Runge spikes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_43oTnTXiw) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@standupmaths/109819371159314006))!</span> Matt Parker on the Runge phenomenon, in which interpolating through more data points can make the quality of interpolation worse. Sadly, no mention of the [Witch of Agnesi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch_of_Agnesi).

* [_Quanta_ on low-surface-area convex polytopes that tile high-dimensional space by integer translations](https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematicians-complete-quest-to-build-spherical-cubes-20230210/) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@QuantaMagazine@mstdn.social/109841124938979652)).</span> Based on "[An integer parallelotope with small surface area](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02862)" by Assaf Naor and Oded Regev.

* I just returned from a week-long workshop at the Bellairs Research Institute in Barbados, my first since the pandemic started <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/109849258853460072)).</span> This time, Bellairs double-booked us with another workshop, so we met in Seabourne House and its ocean-view garden instead of the usual picnic table area. This worked surprisingly well, especially for the morning sessions. The photo below shows some of this area; [the full gallery](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/seabourne/) has a few other shots of architectural details.

* [John Allen Paulos on writing popular mathematics](https://3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2023/02/some-comments-on-writing-popular-mathematics.html) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/109858684384756666)),</span> and Bertrand Russell's other paradox, on the impossibility of combining intelligibility and precision.

* [What can mathematicians do](https://mathstodon.xyz/@aperiodical/109800517387277782) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@aperiodical/109800517387277782))?</span> Recordings of ten talks by disabled mathematicians.

* [Scott Aaronson on the shortsightedness of xenophobia](https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=7028) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/109872087293449471)),</span> triggered by the denial of a visa to a would-have-been-incoming doctoral student from China.
