Just updated the web server on <a href="http://fano.ics.uci.edu/">Fano</a>.  Some minor additions to the bibliographic data there, but nothing very thorough â€” I haven&#x27;t been very well motivated to work on that now that <a href="http://scholar.google.com/">Google scholar</a> has become so much more complete and reliable than Citeseer ever was.
<br />

<br />
The more interesting addition to the server, to me, is <a href="http://fano.ics.uci.edu/ca/rules/b3s23/g16.html">The Seal</a>, a new c/6 diagonal spaceship in Life, <a href="http://gameoflife-news.blogspot.com/2005/09/c6-diagonal-spaceship.html">discovered by Nicolay Beluchenko</a>.  It&#x27;s not easy to add new entries to the <a href="http://pentadecathlon.com/objects/spaceships/small/smallest.shtml">list of known Life spaceship velocities</a>; the most recent one prior to this was the much larger and more complicated <a href="http://www.yucs.org/~gnivasch/life/article_cat/">17c/45 Caterpillar</a> last December.
