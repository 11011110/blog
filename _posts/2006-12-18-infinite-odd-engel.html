2/7 = 1/5 + 1/(5*3) + 1/(5*3*5) + 1/(5*3*5*3) + 1/(5*3*5*3*5) + ... and
<br />
3/7 = 1/3 + 1/(3*5) + 1/(3*5*3) + 1/(3*5*3*5) + 1/(3*5*3*5*3) + ...
<br />

<br />
More generally,
<br />
2/(12n+7) = 1/(6n+5) + 1/(6n+5)(4n+3) + 1/(6n+5)(4n+3)(6n+5) + ... and
<br />
3/(12n+7) = 1/(4n+3) + 1/(4n+3)(6n+5) + 1/(4n+3)(6n+5)(4n+3) + ...
<br />

<br />
So the analogue to the odd greedy Egyptian fraction problem for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engel_expansion">Engel expansion</a> has an immediate negative answer.
<br />

<br />
The same infinite 2/7 and 3/7 expansions also occur as the <a href="http://www.research.att.com/~njas/sequences/A079366">Cost√© prime expansion</a> of these numbers, which is infinite for the same reasons.
