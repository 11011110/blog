Via CACM: <a href="http://discovery.swmed.edu/dejavu/">UT Southwestern&#x27;s Deja Vu project</a> has applied text pattern matching algorithms to all the titles and abstracts in Medline and found up to 200,000 duplicates. Many of them have benign explanations (e.g. the first one I saw was a Chinese-language paper and its English-language translation, by the same authors) but many others are likely plagiarism: the database currently lists <a href="http://discovery.swmed.edu/dejavu/duplicate/?duplication_type__id__exact=2&share_author__exact=0">200 duplicate pairs of abstracts with no author in common</a>. This is just in the abstracts; I imagine that additional similarities would be turned up in a full-text search.

Some care is still required. For example, the first of these &quot;no author in common&quot; duplicates is in fact an article plus a commentary on the article (which, I guess by editorial policy, is introduced with the same abstract.)

Good point. Their <a href="http://discovery.swmed.edu/dejavu/duplicate/?other_type__exact=0&MedLabel__exact=0&MedIssue__exact=0&update_type__exact=0&comment_type__exact=0&share_author__exact=0&duplication_type__id__exact=2">quick link</a> to a more filtered subset of the no author in common duplicates works better.
