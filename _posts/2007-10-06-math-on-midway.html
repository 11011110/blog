<a href="http://jd2718.wordpress.com/2007/10/06/carnival-of-math-18/">Carnival of Mathematics 18</a>, from JD2718. He seems to have made quite an effort to dig up relevant posts: as he says, &quot;it&#x27;s kind of big...&quot;

So my link is showing up on a blog named &quot;just a bear whose intentions are good?&quot; That means I need to point out the absolutely-irrelevant-except-for-the-name post I wrote last week: <a href="http://jd2718.wordpress.com/2007/09/28/sometimes-i-feel-a-little-mad/">Sometimes I feel a little mad</a>. Just had to.

Song lyrics? And something about union politics? Somehow I feel like I missed some context.

Live journal - I don&#x27;t really get it. Your comment showed up on one of your friend&#x27;s lists, and his name seems to be &quot;Just a bear whose intentions are good.&quot; My post title was from the same song... but, he didn&#x27;t post, you did. Live journal confuses me.

It&#x27;s probably due to livejournal being both a blog (if you look at the &quot;recent entries&quot; link for someone&#x27;s account) and an aggregator (if you look at the &quot;friends&quot; link). So if my account is included on someone else&#x27;s friend-list, and you look at that list, you&#x27;ll see my posts in his or her format.
