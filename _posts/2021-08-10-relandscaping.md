We recently redid our front yard, after spending too long with a boring flat weedy mostly-unused and water-thirsty lawn and after our neighbor took out the only part of it that we actually cared for, a liquidambar tree between our yards. This week's WADS/CCCG conference, with its four-hour time difference from Pacific, gave me an excuse to catch it in the early morning light:

I don't have a photo of the old front, so for comparison here's a similar angle snagged from Google Street View.

More for my own later benefit than because I imagine anyone else cares:

The frontmost tree is a [palo verde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinsonia_florida); a neighbor across the street has a much bigger one, a little messy but quite pretty, especially when covered with its yellow flowers. The tree in the back corner with the blue bistro table under it is some kind of mesquite, I think maybe a black mesquite; the flagstone path makes a loop around it. The two tallest bushes, forming a quadrilateral with the two trees, are [pineapple guavas / feijoas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feijoa_sellowiana).

Behind the palo verde and against the house are some [kangaroo paws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangaroo_paw). The closest medium-sized bush on the bottom right (and elsewhere) is [Russian sage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvia_yangii). There are also some [butterfly bushes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddleja_davidii), and several other low bushes and flowers whose names I already lost track of or didn't get. I think the tall bunchgrass may be a [lomandra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lomandra), and the low blue ones [blue fescue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festuca_glauca).

Lining the path to the door is [senecio / blue chalksticks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curio_repens), and there's more of it around the base of the mesquite. The groundcover in front is [dymondia / silver carpet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dymondia) (well, and some crabgrass and spurge, but let's not count that), with some [myoporum parvifolium](Myoporum parvifolium) behind it (the low spreading groundcover with white flowers); there's more myoporum barely visible near the porch bench.

The neighbor ended up replacing the liquidambar (at the far left of the Street View shot) with a [podocarpus henkelii](Podocarpus henkelii) and some bottlebrushes.
