The <a href="http://theory.utdallas.edu/ISAAC2009/accepted-papers.html">list of papers accepted to ISAAC 2009</a>, the 20th International Symposium on Algorithms and Computation is now online. (I&#x27;d be happier if abstracts were also included, but they&#x27;re not.)
<br />

<br />
I never had any thoughts of going to this one, but my colleague and frequent co-author Mike Goodrich has been excited about the possibility of a trip to Hawaii for months, and now he has a good excuse to go. He and his student Darren Strash have a paper there on succinct greedy embedding of planar graphs into the Euclidean plane (related to our previous work on <a href="http://11011110.livejournal.com/142234.html">greedy hyperbolic embedding</a>). The idea is to use a version of the <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/moitra/docs/greedy-routing.pdf">Leighton-Moitra</a> embedding from FOCS 2008 (for 3-connected planar graphs, or more generally graphs containing an appropriate cactus subgraph) and show how to compute O(log n)-bit labels for the vertices in such a way that the embedded location of each vertex is a function (independent of the graph) of its label. In this way they get around the “cheating” aspect of much of the greedy embedding literature, that a single vertex location already encodes enough information by itself to represent an entire routing table.
<br />

<br />
Another result that I&#x27;ve heard of before, mentioned briefly in Erik Demaine&#x27;s invited talk at WADS, is his paper (listing his last name as author twice in his usual egocentric style, also with Konjevodz and famed origamist Robert Lang) “Folding a Better Checkerboard”. If I remember correctly, they save a factor of two in the area of the starting sheet of origami paper (with different colors on its two sides) needed to fold a checkerboard of a given size (in which the two colors alternate to form an 8×8 grid of squares).
<br />

There are many more titles that look interesting to me but that I don&#x27;t know a lot more about than the title itself. I&#x27;m sure it will be an interesting conference, and if you haven&#x27;t already done your planning for Hawaii in December, now would be a good time.
