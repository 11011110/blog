Or, why I couldn&#x27;t attend the FOCS program committee meeting last weekend.
<br />

<br />
Instead, I took a road trip to Mendocino, where my cousin Angela and her beau Chris got married. Most of Angela&#x27;s and my relatives live in New Zealand, but several of them came to California for the occasion. The first official event of the wedding (or at least the first one I had any involvement in) was the <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/angela+chris/rehearsaldinner/index.html">rehearsal dinner</a> at my parents&#x27; house. Traditionally this is for family and out-of-town guests only, but since pretty much everyone was from out of town that made for a large guest list. There was much admiring of the <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/angela+chris/quilt/index.html">quilt</a> my aunt Pat made and brought from NZ, I and others took (too many) photos and <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/angela+chris/shutterbugs/index.html">admired each others&#x27; cameras</a>, and there was much eating and drinking and whatever else one does at rehearsal dinners. Timothy and his cousins Aaron and Logan and the groom&#x27;s kid brother Oliver and one or two other boys whose names I didn&#x27;t catch stayed out of our way <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/angela+chris/gameboys/index.html">playing their gameboys</a> in another room, and talking about their games, as seems to be the fashion among preteen boys.
<br />

<br />
The next morning I took an urgent call from Chris: could I come over to where <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/angela+chris/groomsmen/index.html">the groomsmen were getting ready</a> and shoot a few candids of them? I&#x27;m not the official photographer (who seemed quite competent) but she was busy doing the same thing with the women, so I agreed. Back at my parents&#x27; house, the bridesmaids took rather longer than the men to get dressed, and then we had to stop for photos of them on the <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/angela+chris/bridalcarriage/index.html">bridal carriage</a>, a horse-drawn carriage that my uncle Derek, Angela&#x27;s father, drives for tourists on Fisherman&#x27;s wharf.

<br />
<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/angela+chris/prewedding/1-s.jpg">The wedding site</a> was a spectacular picnic area on a point overlooking the ocean in Russian Gulch state park. Everyone waved and cheered when we caught sight of the carriage crossing the Russian Gulch bridge, and laughed a little at the long line of traffic held up behind it. The <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/angela+chris/wedding/index.html">service</a> was simple and brief, involving a reading from John Donne and a short sermon by the minister, a Zen buddhist in the Japanese tradition, together with the usual exchanges of vows and rings. <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/angela+chris/postwedding/index.html">After the service</a> the photographer did some group shots, I cheated off a few of her setups while waiting my turn to stand and pose, and <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/angela+chris/feedingthehorse/index.html">the boys fed the horse again</a>. We then took some rented vans a few miles up the coast to Caspar, where the <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/angela+chris/reception/index.html">reception</a> was held, ate a good wedding dinner catered by the groom&#x27;s father (whose day job is catering for Hollywood) and partied into the night. Or as much into the night as our kids could take; we left around ten, as we had to get going back to Southern California starting the next morning so that we could attend <a href="http://11011110.livejournal.com/142637.html?mode=reply">Sara&#x27;s middle school promotion</a>, but I heard that the dancing continued until much later.
<br />

<br />
...And it&#x27;s taken until now to sort through all the photos. In the interest of completeness, I haven&#x27;t been as ruthless as usual about deleting the questionable or redundant shots, but that led to a lot more time in Photoshop processing them all. The galleries are as linked above, or if you want a single link that leads to all of them, <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/angela+chris/index.html">here it is</a>.
