<p>I love the light of evening games late in the softball season. <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/riptide/sb/index.html">Friday's game against Silver Bullets</a> was a great example. More shots of the girls hanging out in the dugout or standing at bat than actual action, because I liked the light so much that I had to keep even the actionless ones.  Here's my favorite, which I <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/11011110/142010763/">already posted at flickr</a>:</p>

<p>Also, a <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/riptide/kf2/index.html">Saturday afternoon game against Killer Frogs</a>. The June gloom has started already this year, so it was gray and overcast like the previous week, but I still found a few shots to like.</p>
