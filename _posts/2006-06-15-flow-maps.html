The idea seems to be to visually express how much movement there is from different geographically placed sources to a single sink, by drawing the movement as a confluent tree in which physically nearby sources are merged together, and the thickness of a confluent edge indicates the amount of movement along that edge. So it&#x27;s closely related to confluent graph drawing, but not the same, because the initial data is not so much a graph as a spatial numeric field (the amount of movement from each site) and the confluent tracks merge but don&#x27;t unmerge. However, there is some graph drawing involved, in placing the edges and merge nodes of the resulting tree so that it doesn&#x27;t cross itself.
