The author notifications for Graph Drawing 2006 have just gone out â€” I found out that my three submissions, &quot;Upright-Quad Drawing of st-Planar Learning Spaces&quot;, &quot;Trees with Convex Faces and Optimal Angles&quot; (with Josiah Carlson), and &quot;Choosing Colors for Geometric Graphs via Color Space Embeddings&quot; (with Mike Dillencourt and Mike Goodrich) all got in. Preprint versions to be made available once we incorporate the comments from the committee.
<br />

<br />
I don&#x27;t see a public list of accepted papers yet but I imagine it will be made available soon.
