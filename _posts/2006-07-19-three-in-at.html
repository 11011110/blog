<p>The author notifications for Graph Drawing 2006 have just gone out â€” I found out that my three submissions, "Upright-Quad Drawing of <i>st</i>-Planar Learning Spaces", "Trees with Convex Faces and Optimal Angles" (with Josiah Carlson), and "Choosing Colors for Geometric Graphs via Color Space Embeddings" (with Mike Dillencourt and Mike Goodrich) all got in. Preprint versions to be made available once we incorporate the comments from the committee.</p>

<p>I don't see a public list of accepted papers yet but I imagine it will be made available soon.</p>
