<p>Unclassified scientists and other workers at <s>Yoyodyne</s> JPL (a government lab devoted to space science and operated by CalTech) are now being <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=aFL9TZmNpSvA&refer=us">required to undergo an intrusive government background check process</a> that, among other things, examines their sexual history and orientation. There&#x27;s no statement that their political leanings are also being examined, but there&#x27;s also no statement that they aren&#x27;t.</p>

<p>This quote from the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/california/la-me-jpl31aug31,1,153216.story">L.A. Times version of the story</a> is especially unreassuring, given the present administration&#x27;s history of politicizing previously nonpartisan executive-branch units:</p>

<blockquote><i>David Mould, a NASA spokesman in Washington, said JPL employees were being treated no differently than other executive branch workers.</i></blockquote>

The Bloomsberg version of the story states that &quot;the requirements are part of a uniform identification system for federal employees&quot;, but the <a href="http://nytimes.com/2007/08/31/us/31nasa.html">New York times clarifies that the affected scientists are not actually federal employees</a>.
