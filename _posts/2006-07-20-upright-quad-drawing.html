One of my Graph Drawing papers, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.CG/0607094">Upright-Quad Drawing of <i>st</i>-Planar Learning Spaces</a>, is now up at the arXiv. It&#x27;s about graphs formed from antimatroids by drawing edges between pairs of sets that differ in a single element, but it&#x27;s also about a principle that I think can apply more generally in graph drawing: <b>if you&#x27;re drawing graphs with a special structure, then the drawing should make the structure visually apparent</b>: it should be of a type that exists only for graphs having that structure.
<br />

<br />
E.g., if you have an application where it&#x27;s important that its graphs are planar, then they should be drawn without crossings so that people looking at them can see that they&#x27;re planar. For the graphs I&#x27;m interested in here, the structure is made apparent by a drawing in which all faces are quadrilaterals with the bottom and left sides parallel to the coordinate axis (and where the drawing has unique top-right and bottom-left vertices); such a drawing only exists for graphs coming from antimatroids.  The paper also outlines close connections between these graph drawings and arrangements of pseudolines formed by translates of a 90-degree wedge; as shown below, if you draw the dual of such an arrangement by placing a vertex at the top right corner of each region, you get a drawing of this type. (The dotted lines in the right side of the drawing are the parts of the pseudolines not covered by graph edges.)

Coincidentally, today I also ran across <a href="http://bodmas.org/blog/?p=441">this diagram of GCSE math topics</a> on <a href="http://www.bodmas.org/blog/">bodmas</a>; it shows in a less formal way the same sort of thing I&#x27;m trying to approach with this paper: diagrams of concepts from some body of knowledge and the prerequisites necessary to learn them.
