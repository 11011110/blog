For the past few years I&#x27;ve been carrying around a small notebook to jot down notes from talks, research ideas, expenses, etc. (I guess I could do it on my phone but I prefer pen and paper.) I like writing with fountain pens, but don&#x27;t care to carry around an expensive one: I don&#x27;t feel I need to impress people with how much I spend on accessories, and I don&#x27;t want to worry about losing it. I had been using disposable Pilot Varsity pens, but occasionally (especially if I took them on airplanes) I would end up with ink all over my fingers, so I recently tried switching to an inexpensive refillable pen, the Lamy Safari (fine point, with refilling attachment and Noodler&#x27;s forest green ink). Below is a comparison of how my notes look with the two pens:
<br />

<br />

<br />
The Lamy feels less scratchy than the Pilots, but I didn&#x27;t really mind the scratchiness. The more important differences in the way it feels to me are that the Lamy&#x27;s bigger size fits my hand better and lets me hold my fingers a little farther away from the tip (making inky fingers less likely), and its triangular cross-section gives me a more consistent orientation, so I find myself holding the pen the wrong way less often. The writing comes out less blotchy, with better control of the line weight, and I don&#x27;t feel that I have to write as large to make it legible. There&#x27;s also significantly less bleed-through on the Moleskine square-ruled paper I&#x27;ve been using, although it&#x27;s still nonzero.
<br />

<br />
I still don&#x27;t know if these pens are more reliable in the air, but on the whole I&#x27;d say this is a big step up in writing quality.

Thanks for this nice comparison! I have rather small fingers. Which one of these two pens would you recommend for me? I quite like Pilots, but never tried this one before.

I think the Lamy would be a good choice regardless. Unless you have really tiny hands, it should fit well enough. It&#x27;s not a huge pen, just a little bigger than the other one.

Thank you! May I bother you just with one more question :) What is kind of the notebooks these are? I am using moleskines, but would also like to learn about other good ones, as moleskines are quite expensive. :)

The ones in the picture? They&#x27;re just Moleskines. I haven&#x27;t really tried searching for alternatives very thoroughly.

Yes, I was asking about ones on the picture :) Well, Moleskines are great. I was just curious if there are any alternatives :)
Anyway, thanks again for your answers. ;-)

What about reasonably priced notebooks? I love the moleskins, but it costs way too much for some dead wood.

Alternatives are not hard to find, I think. Alternatives that fit in a pocket, have a nice protective cover, and use square-ruled paper may be a little scarcer, I don&#x27;t know. I like the Moleskines well enough that I haven&#x27;t really tried looking for something cheaper.

I also like carrying around a fountain pen and paper to scribble math. I use a nemosine I ordered from Amazon (cheaper than Lamy, and it writes well, although I did accidentally manage to chip its cap pretty easily).

(Edit) - oh, I&#x27;ve never commented on livejournal. I&#x27;m not used to my openid gravatar not being automatically ported over. Having no portrait makes me feel less... legitimate or something. But I am!

Not worrying about chips and scratches is another good reason to go with an inexpensive one.

You&#x27;re at Brown? I know some people there, but they&#x27;re all in computer science, not math, I think.

You should try a sheaffer prelude 340 !
I too take a lot of notes, the sheaffer one brilliant fp (provided you don&#x27;t mind its heavy weight).

Not bad looking, but about twice the price of the Lamy.
