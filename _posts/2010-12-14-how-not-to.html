<a href="http://teachingintrotocs.blogspot.com/">Claire Mathieu has a blog</a>. It only took me three months to notice. <a href="http://teachingintrotocs.blogspot.com/2010/12/how-not-to-present-algorithms.html">Her latest post</a>, the one that led me to her, is a fine rant about an old scourge of computer science, spaghetti code, and its applications to the problem of making algorithms research papers unreadable.

The problem of deciding whether a one is too mentally lacking to understand a paper, or that it&#x27;s just poorly written is NP-complete. There are approximation algorithm, such as provides source code, or self confidence.

Maybe, but when it&#x27;s a respected algorithms researcher that&#x27;s complaining about not being able to understand a paper, I think the probability is quite high that it&#x27;s just poorly written.

of course, I was talking about myself.
