<p>Yesterday I went up to L.A. to see <a href="http://www.moca.org/">MOCA</a>, and its sister museum the Geffen Contemporary a short walk away. I came back with <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/moca-dh/index.html">some pictures</a> of art and of the nearby <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_Concert_Hall">Disney Hall</a>.</p>

<p>I don't usually take or keep photos of individual 2d artworks (what could I add as a photographer to what's already there?) but I wanted a copy of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Orozco">Gabriel Orozco</a> print below. The blend of organic and geometric forms appeals to me, and (despite the lack of conspiracy theories) his use of line reminds me a bit of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Lombardi">Mark Lombardi</a>.</p>
