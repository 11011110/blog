<p>I recently traveled to Ensenada (my first visit to Mexico, despite its closeness) for <a href="http://latin2016.natix.org/">LATIN 2016</a>. This was our view every morning on our arrival to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensenada_Center_for_Scientific_Research_and_Higher_Education">CICESE</a>, the research center hosting the conference, for the conference breakfast.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="CICESE, Ensenada, Mexico" src="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/ensenada/CICESE2-m.jpg" style="border-style:solid;border-color:black;" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/ensenada/index.html">The rest of my photos</a> include several from the conference excursion and dinner in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guadalupe,_Baja_California">Valle de Guadalupe</a>, Mexico&#x27;s wine region.</p>
