I recently traveled to Ensenada (my first visit to Mexico, despite its closeness) for <a href="http://latin2016.natix.org/">LATIN 2016</a>. This was our view every morning on our arrival to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensenada_Center_for_Scientific_Research_and_Higher_Education">CICESE</a>, the research center hosting the conference, for the conference breakfast.
