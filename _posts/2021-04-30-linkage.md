* [The EFF on FLoC](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/googles-floc-terrible-idea) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/106079326968515725)), Google's plan for browsers to aggregate your browsing habits and make them public for ad-personalization. Short summary: it's a bad idea and if you care about privacy you should switch to a non-Chrome browser. Technical summary: it's based on [k-anonymity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-anonymity), known as [inadequate at protecting individual privacy in social networks](https://doi.org/10.1109/CASoN.2010.139). If you use Chrome, assume all bad guys on the web can see all your browsing.

* Relevant to my recent post on Pick's theorem: [Chris Staecker on the dot planimeter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osF2JhrVHxc) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/106090366361151274)), a device for [approximating area by counting grid points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_planimeter).

* [Students of University of Minnesota assistant professor Kangjie Lu caught allegedly deliberately sending buggy patches to Linux kernel as some kind of breaching experiment](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-nfs/YH+zwQgBBGUJdiVK@unreal/), resulting in [the whole university being banned from Linux kernel development](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-nfs/YH%2FfM%2FTsbmcZzwnX@kroah.com/) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/106104208447478044), [via](https://lobste.rs/s/3qgyzp/they_introduce_kernel_bugs_on_purpose)). They claim to have been declared IRB-exempt but this appears to be a mistake by the IRB. See also [department reaction](https://cse.umn.edu/cs/statement-cse-linux-kernel-research-april-21-2021) and [metafilter discussion](https://www.metafilter.com/191207/How-to-get-your-University-banned-in-1-easy-step).

* [You could prove that the number of integer solutions to $$x^2+xy+y^2=a$$ is a multiple of six for positive $$a$$ by finding a hidden group structure](https://www.flyingcoloursmaths.co.uk/a-pretty-puzzle/) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/106113101236984677)). Or, you could recognize that it's the norm of the Eisenstein integers under a small change of basis from the usual one and that they have six-fold rotational symmetry.

* [Paper engineering from the Bauhaus](https://www.origamitessellations.com/2018/03/paper-engineering-from-the-bauhaus-josef-albers-to-the-modern-day/) and [reverse-engineering Bauhaus paper designs](https://www.origamitessellations.com/2018/04/reverse-engineering-bauhaus-paper-designs-part-two/) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/106118829181433597)). These designs are more curved kirigami than origami, producing smooth-looking 3d shapes from cut sheets of flat paper.

* [The art of mathematics in chalk](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-art-of-mathematics-in-chalk/) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/106124866673951925), [see also](https://whatsonmyblackboard.wordpress.com/)). Teaser for the forthcoming book _Do Not Erase: Mathematicians and Their Chalkboards_, featuring several photographic spreads of chalkboard illustrations and formulas and their explanations. They appear to be mostly set-ups rather than captured from active research, but still pretty and interesting. [I linked an earlier post on this in 2019]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2019-09-30-linkage %}) but with fewer photos and no explanations.

* [The Coq theorem prover brainstorms a name change](https://coq.discourse.group/t/renaming-coq/1264) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/106127971601789143), [via](https://www.metafilter.com/191240/Not-every-woman-is-offended-by-this-name-but-enough-people-are)), after too many women get harrassed for saying they work on Coq.

* [Tetrad puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrad_(geometry_puzzle)) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/106136227486814000)). It's possible to arrange four congruent hexagons so they tile a disk with each pair sharing a length of boundary, but the known pentagons with four pairwise-touching copies leave a hole in the region they tile. Is the hole necessary?

* [Mercator Rotator](https://github.andrewt.net/mercator-rotator/) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mastodon.social/@andrewt/105950778379233419)), a tool for drawing Mercator-projection world maps with different viewpoints than the usual one. Set the pole on a place you don't like to see the map of a world without it.

* [Tetrahedra passing through a hole](https://mathoverflow.net/q/138752/440) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/106152970915208525)). This is from eight years ago, but was active again recently. The question is: what's the smallest-area hole in a plane through which you can push a unit tetrahedron? DPKR has a very pretty animated answer, but sadly it's not optimal: there's a triangular hole with smaller area $$1/\sqrt{8}$$, known [minimal for translational motion](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comgeo.2011.07.004). The problem for more general motion seems to be still open.

* [Lagarias's survey on the Takagi Function](http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.4205v2) and [Mallows' survey on Conway's $10,000 sequence](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2324028) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/106153079186577081), [via](https://mathstodon.xyz/@esoterica/106152848486538030), [see also](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blancmange_curve)) have very similar-looking figures, but little or no overlap in references. Maybe someone knows of an explanation for the similarity?
