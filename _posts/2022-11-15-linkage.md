The massive influx of new users and new content to Mastodon has caused a greater number of these to be boosts of someone else's post rather than posts of my own.

* [_Quanta_ has a nice profile of my colleague at UC Irvine, Ukrainian-born mathematician Svetlana Jitomirskaya](https://www.quantamagazine.org/in-math-and-life-svetlana-jitomirskaya-stares-down-complexity-20221101/) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/109269250786290297)).</span>

* [A cardboard model of the "impossible" Penrose triangle](https://westy31.home.xs4all.nl/Penrose/Carboard_Impossible_Penrose_triangle.html) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@GerardWestendorp/109259133843305538)),</span> with construction instructions, a printable cutout, and a demo video link, by Gerard Westendorp.

* [Organic algorithm series](https://ventrella.com/organic-algorithm/) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/109282060578920502)),</span> artworks by Jeffrey Ventrella.

* Fatih Kızılkaya, a student of David Kempe at USC, gave an excellent talk in our theory seminar on ["Plurality Veto" voting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07098) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/109288019438622582)).</span> The idea is to count first-place votes per candidate, then let each voter cancel a single vote for their least-favorite remaining candidate (one voter at a time or simultaneously and fractionally) until only one candidate has votes left. With voters and candidates in a metric space and preferences by distance, this 3-approximates the min average distance to voters, best possible.

* [Getting an academic publication cited on Wikipedia tends to lead to more citations elsewhere, and open-access publications tend to be more frequently cited on Wikipedia](https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2022/11/01/guest-post-wikipedias-citations-are-influencing-scholars-and-publishers/) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/109292417799090772),</span> [via](https://retractionwatch.com/2022/11/05/weekend-reads-double-edition-sciences-nasty-photoshopping-problem-dr-ozs-publication-ban-image-manipulation-detection-software/)).

* [Every finite colouring of the plane contains a monochromatic pair of points at an odd distance from each other](https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2022/10/19/james-davies-every-finite-colouring-of-the-plane-contains-a-monochromatic-pair-of-points-at-an-odd-distance-from-each-other/) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/109299861480951154)),</span> based on [a new arXiv preprint by James Davies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15598). The paper is pretty heavy going and the linked blog post doesn't give much detail, so providing a more generally understandable version of this looks like a challenge.

* [How (not) to compute harmonic numbers](http://fredrik-j.blogspot.com/2009/02/how-not-to-compute-harmonic-numbers.html) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@peterluschny/109280460006661224)).</span> Like for factorials, exact computation using divide-and-conquer works much better than the obvious method of sequentially adding each unit fraction. But factorials have an even faster algorithm; it's unclear whether the same idea can be made to work for the harmonic numbers.

* [Erik Demaine's geometric folding algorithms course lectures](http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.849/fall12/lectures/C01.html)
 <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@j2kun/109305200398869548)).</span>

* [xkcd on the bridges of Königsburg](https://xkcd.com/2694/) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mastodon.xyz/@xkcd/109288968362775008)).</span> This one is definitely going into my lecture notes for the next time it comes around.

* News I didn't know about the university I work for, UC Irvine: apparently [we're an "esports powerhouse"](https://www.latimes.com/sports/story/2022-11-01/esports-uc-irvine-overwatch-league-of-legends-valorant) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/109322880998262132),</span> [archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20221107065218/https://www.latimes.com/sports/story/2022-11-01/esports-uc-irvine-overwatch-league-of-legends-valorant)). Definitely preferable to funneling all the alumni donations into football stadium construction! (Unlike many big US universities we don't have a football team and I like it that way.)

* Zhao Liang asks: [which polyhedra have the property that if you make them out of mirrors and stand inside, you will see a tessellation of space?](https://mathstodon.xyz/@neozhaoliang/109324352766569049)

* [About mandatory attendance by presenters at CS research conferences](https://discrete-notes.github.io/mandatory-attendance) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/109331612952132380)).</span> I [just attended LATIN]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2022-11-13-report-from-latin %}), a hybrid in person/online conference that ended up heavily tilted to in-person participation. In-person clearly leads to significantly greater interaction rather than mere passive reception of talks. I am very attracted to the idea of reducing the carbon footprint of my travel but in my experience we have not found a successful online replacement for that aspect of conferencing.

* [Dave Richeson folds a regular octagon from a strip of paper](https://mathstodon.xyz/@divbyzero/109314296701448645).

* Our graduate students and their union went on strike yesterday. The [_LA Times_ has a photo-essay](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-11-14/photos-strike-by-48-000-university-of-california-academic-workers-causes-systemwide-disruptions)  <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/109345285468088888),</span> [archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20221115011509/https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-11-14/photos-strike-by-48-000-university-of-california-academic-workers-causes-systemwide-disruptions)). For the union's demands and university's counteroffers see [this story](https://www.statnews.com/2022/11/14/university-of-california-academic-workers-go-out-on-strike-to-demand-higher-wages/).
You can also find recent [grad student](https://www.ucop.edu/academic-personnel-programs/_files/2022/oct-2021-scales/t22.pdf) and [faculty](https://www.ucop.edu/academic-personnel-programs/_files/2022-23/oct-2022-salary-scales/t1.pdf) salary scales online, but note that notionally at least the student salaries are for halftime work.
