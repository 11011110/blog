Via <a href="http://mysliceofpizza.blogspot.com/2007/07/mihai-slams.html">Muthu</a>, another new theoretical CS blog: <a href="http://infoweekly.blogspot.com/">WebDiarios de Motocicleta</a>, by Mihai Pătraşcu. Mihai describes his goal as to have &quot;algorithms become not only the language of science, but the language of Math itself.&quot; His early posts involve bijective combinatorics and Google ads for algorithms papers. Welcome to the blogosphere, Mihai!
