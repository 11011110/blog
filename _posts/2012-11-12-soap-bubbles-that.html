<p>Single soap bubbles (as opposed to foams and bubble rafts) aren't really things I think about as being fractal — they're nice mathematical spheres, right? — but there does seem to be a lot of interesting microstructure visible in these photos.</p>

<p>That's what I was thinking about. If you look at the patterns, they are a lot like the cloud structure on planets like Jupiter and Saturn, which, IIRC, can be modeled fractally.</p>

<p>But we're way out of my area and into yours here, so I'm going to shut up now. :-)</p>

<p>She just returned home Monday evening, for Thanksgiving. She's been doing well, making friends, etc., but was very ready to come home again. Yours went to Berkeley, right? You must have already been seeing her more often, since it's so much closer.</p>
