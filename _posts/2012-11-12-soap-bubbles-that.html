Wow. <p></p>&quot;Fractals, fractals, everywhere.&quot;

Single soap bubbles (as opposed to foams and bubble rafts) aren&#x27;t really things I think about as being fractal — they&#x27;re nice mathematical spheres, right? — but there does seem to be a lot of interesting microstructure visible in these photos.

That&#x27;s what I was thinking about. If you look at the patterns, they are a lot like the cloud structure on planets like Jupiter and Saturn, which, IIRC, can be modeled fractally.

But we&#x27;re way out of my area and into yours here, so I&#x27;m going to shut up now. :-)

(How&#x27;s your eldest doing?)

She just returned home Monday evening, for Thanksgiving. She&#x27;s been doing well, making friends, etc., but was very ready to come home again. Yours went to Berkeley, right? You must have already been seeing her more often, since it&#x27;s so much closer.
