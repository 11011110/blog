<p>Just realized that I neglected to put online the slides from my talks at the Symposium on Computational Geometry in Pisa a month ago.  Here they are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/EppWor-SoCG-05.pdf">Minimum Dilation Stars</a>. Where to place the hub of a star-topology transportation network in order to minimize the ratio between straight-line distance and networked distance.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/EppGooSun-SoCG-05.pdf">The Skip Quadtree: A Simple Dynamic Data Structure for Multidimensional Data</a>. Same material as the <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.CG/0507049">paper</a> I uploaded <a href="{{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2005-07-20-big-batch-o %}">a couple of days ago</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>They're now also linked from the relevant entries in my <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/">online publications list</a>.</p>
