Fewer links than usual this time because of all my Japan posts.

* [The number of convex layers in a square grid](https://oeis.org/A290966) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/32p3w4KWLXn)). A new entry in the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences.

* [The program from the Canadian Conference on Computational Geometry](http://2017.cccg.ca/program.html) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/7CZF94dmRVS)), now with video links for most of the talks.

* [Awards from ALGO 2017](https://algo2017.ac.tuwien.ac.at/awards/) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/LFbnwZzjCqx)), including the Nerode Prize to Fomin, Grandoni, and Kratsch for "measure and conquer".

* [Perimeter-halving centers](https://mathoverflow.net/q/280493/440) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/fgza6Avgkaw)), a possibly-new triangle center defined by Joe O'Rourke based on distance to the nearest chord that bisects the perimeter.

* [The forgotten history of the Harvard Observatory computers](https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-07-27/team-women-are-unearthing-forgotten-legacy-harvard-s-women-computers) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/VehtcPbKS81)). "In the late 1800s, they were famous, only to be virtually forgotten during the next century. A recent discovery of thousands of pages of their calculations by a modern group of women has spurred new interest in their legacy."

* [The readability of scientific texts is decreasing over time](https://elifesciences.org/articles/27725) according to a new research report ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/crBrYK9kVLz)). Many scientists could do much more to make their work readable. But in the G+ comments, Mark Wilson points out that [they might not have much incentive to do so](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004205).

* [Kawasaki's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawasaki%27s_theorem) characterizing flat-foldable single-vertex origami patterns ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/G4DVJfaTGB2)), now a Good Article on Wikipedia.

* [The complete Graph Drawing proceedings, now on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04228) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/arRZovJMvnv)). See G+ for discussion of why we still might need conventional publishers.

* [Divination by program committee](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2017/9/220429-divination-by-program-committee/fulltext) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/UebF5u6go7X)). As Moshe Vardi points out, after picking off the easy accepts and easy rejects, the remaining selections of conference submission acceptances are essentially random. So why don't we save a lot of effort and produce a more scalable system of fewer bigger conferences by just taking them all?

* [Minima Maxima by Marc Fornes](http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2017/09/a-towering-4-story-organic-structure-built-from-material-as-thin-as-a-coin-by/) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/1TyZtnNyQ6F)), a tall self-supporting structure resembling a minimal surface built out of thin layers of aluminum composite.
