<p>Apparently, it's now possible to get a list of visible tags for a livejournal.  Good news.  I'm assuming the ugly formatting will eventually be cleaned up — part of it's the fault of the css stylesheet I cooked up for myself, which I can't edit due to my current inability to do anything other than web browsing, but part of it's the fact that LJ's s2 style system <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/community/s2flexisquares/127895.html">hasn't completely caught up</a> to the availability of this new content.</p>
