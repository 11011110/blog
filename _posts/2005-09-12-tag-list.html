Apparently, <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/11011110/tag/">it&#x27;s now possible to get a list of visible tags for a livejournal</a>.  Good news.  I&#x27;m assuming the ugly formatting will eventually be cleaned up — part of it&#x27;s the fault of the css stylesheet I cooked up for myself, which I can&#x27;t edit due to my current inability to do anything other than web browsing, but part of it&#x27;s the fact that LJ&#x27;s s2 style system <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/community/s2flexisquares/127895.html">hasn&#x27;t completely caught up</a> to the availability of this new content.
