<p>The <a href="http://projects.cs.dal.ca/wads07/accepted.html">list of accepted papers for WADS 2007</a> has been posted to the conference web site.</p>

<p>I have two papers there (out of three submissions): "Edges and switches, tunnels and bridges", with Marc van Kreveld, Elena Mumford, and Bettina Speckmann, and "Space-efficient straggler identification in round-trip data streams via Newton's identities and invertible Bloom filters", with Mike Goodrich.</p>

<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.3313">The streaming straggler paper</a> also just became available at the arxiv. The problem involves handling a large sequence of checkin and checkout requests, most of which are expected to be matched in pairs, and determining from them a much smaller set of mismatched requests. If the only kind of mismatch is a checkin without a checkout, we have an algebraic solution with optimal space; for more general sequences of requests we have a randomized algorithm with slightly more space, and a proof that no deterministic solution is possible (essentially the only thing you can do is to map the group Z^n, representing the numbers of requests for each id, down to a smaller group, and any group map will have a nontrivial kernel that forces you to confuse a perfectly matched request sequence with a mismatched one).</p>

<p>Also new on arxiv: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.2919">On Verifying and Engineering the Well-gradedness of a Union-closed Family</a>. A new paper (unrelated to WADS) with J.-C. Falmagne and H. Uzun, on testing whether the union-closure of a set family contains enough sets that you can connect every pair of sets in the closure by a short path of insertion and deletion operations, always staying within the closure. This path-connectedness is important for the computerized learning systems of Falmagne's company (Uzun's employer) because it translates to the condition that one can learn a set of concepts one at a time without running into cyclic dependencies in their prerequisites.</p>

<p>I'm hoping that the edge and switch paper can be made online soon as well, but it's not there yet. It's about drawing edge crossings in graphs as over-under relationships, and choosing whether to go over or under at each crossing in order to improve the readability of the drawing.</p>
