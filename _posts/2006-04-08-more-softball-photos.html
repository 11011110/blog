<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/riptide/ok/">Riptide vs. Outkast</a>. Finally a game after a lot of rainouts. The weather cooperated and gave me some very pretty late afternoon light in the dugout and on the field. Not such good light for the batters, who had to squint into the sun to see the signals from the coach at third base. Two more games to shoot today, but I don&#x27;t know how long it will be until I can find time to process them and get them up.
