What I thought about during today&#x27;s midterm:
<br />

<br />
For any <i>k</i> there is a configuration of points and planes of type (3<i>k</i><sub>5</sub>), generalizing the (9<sub>5</sub>). Simply place the points at the 2<i>k</i> vertices of a <i>k</i>-gonal prism, and at the <i>k</i> points where the diagonals cross in each of the prism&#x27;s quadrilateral faces. There are <i>k</i> planes containing the quadrilateral faces, and 2<i>k</i> planes through each prism vertex and its two incident diagonals. The only requirement is that the prism be embedded in such a way that its quadrilateral faces are planar, but that still leaves a lot of degrees of freedom; for instance it can be knotted.
