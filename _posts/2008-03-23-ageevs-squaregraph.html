<p>A. A. Ageev, in his paper "a triangle-free circle graph with chromatic number 5" <small>[Discrete Math. <b>152</b>: 295â€“298, 1996]</small>, constructed a chord diagram with 220 chords that needs five colors in any coloring for which crossing chords are given different colors; this is the maximum possible number of colors needed for any triangle-free chord diagram. The dual graph of Ageev's arrangement is a large squaregraph. Using the labeling scheme from <a href="{{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2008-03-22-labeling-cells-of %}">my previous post</a> together with some drawing algorithms from <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.DS/0406020">one of my papers</a>, I was able to draw it, with each face drawn as a rhombus:</p>

<p>Since the diagram is hard to view near the edges where the rhombi get very sharp, here's a blowup of one of its five lobes. The other four are symmetric.</p>

<p><b>ETA:</b> the chord diagram itself, drawn as a hyperbolic line arrangement. I'll leave 5-coloring it as an exercise...</p>

<p>Amazing! Chord diagrams must have a great potential as tablecloths.</p>
