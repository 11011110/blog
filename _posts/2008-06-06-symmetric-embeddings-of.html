<p>A cubic symmetric graph is a graph in which every vertex has exactly three neighbors, and in which there are symmetries taking every vertex to every other vertex and every edge to every other edge; a catalog of these graphs, up to 768 vertices, can be found in the <a href="http://people.csse.uwa.edu.au/gordon/remote/foster/">“Foster census.”</a></p>

<p>Each row of the adjacency matrix of a cubic symmetric graph can be interpreted as a vector of 0-1 coordinates for the vertex corresponding to that row. This interpretation embeds the graph onto a \( (n-1) \)-dimensional hypersphere, the intersection of the sphere of radius \( \sqrt{3} \) centered at the origin with the hyperplane \( \sum x_i=3 \). Every symmetry of the graph is preserved as a symmetry of the embedding, but the dimension is too large for this to be useful in visualization. In some cases we can get a much lower dimensional embedding that still preserves all the symmetries, or at least enough of them to be sure that the graph is symmetric.</p>

<p>Two dimensions is too small for anything interesting to happen, but here are three examples in 3d. The complete graph \( K_4 \), when embedded using its adjacency matrix, turns into the skeleton of a regular tetrahedron (drawn below with curved edges on a sphere). But the regular cube and regular dodecahedron also have three-dimensional symmetric embeddings despite having larger numbers of vertices.</p>

<p>There are two more especially nice examples in four dimensions. Draw the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentatope">pentatope</a> as a regular subdivision of the unit sphere in four dimensions into spherical tetrahedra, place a vertex at the midpoint of each edge and at the centroid of each triangle of this subdivision, and place a great-circle edge connecting every edge midpoint with every centroid of an adjacent triangle. The result is a symmetric embedding of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desargues_graph">Desargues graph</a> in which every vertex has three edges meeting at 120-degree angles. The same edge-triangle placement also works starting from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-cell">24-cell</a> to produce a nice embedding of a 192-vertex cubic symmetric graph.</p>

<p>The square flat torus can be embedded onto a hypersphere in 4d as the solution to the equations \( x^2+y^2=1 \) and \( w^2+z^2=1 \), but the graphs embeddable in a symmetric way onto the square torus all have four edges per vertex. I'm not so sure about the hexagonal torus. If it also has a symmetry-preserving embedding onto the unit sphere in 4d, then an infinite family of cubic symmetric graphs <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/2007/10/20/more-on-cubic.html">formed by cutting and gluing part of the hexagonal tiling of the plane</a> would have four-dimensional symmetric sphere embeddings. The hexagonal torus does at least embed nicely into a hypersphere in six dimensions with the coordinates
\[
\bigl(\sin\theta, \cos\theta, \sin\varphi, \cos\varphi, \sin(\theta+\varphi), \cos(\theta+\varphi)\bigr),
\]
providing six-dimensional symmetric embeddings for this infinite family of graphs.</p>
