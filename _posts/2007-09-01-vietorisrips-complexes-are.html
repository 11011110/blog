title:  'Vietoris–Rips complexes are Čech complexes'

<p>Based in part on Jeff Erickson's nice invited talk on algorithms for finding small cycles in topological spaces at WADS, I just added a brief survey on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietoris%E2%80%93Rips_complex">Vietoris–Rips complexes</a> to Wikipedia.</p>

<p>I'm a little worried that one point I included may violate Wikipedia's prohibition on original research, though: the Vietoris–Rips complex of any metric space <i>X</i> turns out to always equal the Čech complex of some set of balls in some larger space into which <i>X</i> can be embedded.</p>

<p>Specifically, if <i>X</i> is embedded in any <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injective_metric_space">injective metric space</a> <i>Y</i>, then the Vietoris–Rips complex for distance δ in <i>X</i> is the same as the Čech complex for the balls of radius δ/2 centered at the points of <i>X</i> in <i>Y</i>: the Rips complex includes a simplex for any finite set of balls that intersect pairwise, the Čech complex includes a simplex for any finite set of balls with a common intersection, and an injective metric space is defined by the property that any set of balls that intersect pairwise has a common intersection. Since any metric space can be embedded in an injective space via the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tight_span">tight span</a>, the result follows.</p>

<p>This seems obvious enough (and important enough) that I'd include it in a survey or research paper on a related subject without attempting to assign or take credit for it, but Wikipedia has different standards: everything must have a source. So, can anyone help me find a published paper that includes something resembling this statement? I suppose in the worst case that this blog post might suffice, but it's not a very good source by Wikipedian standards...</p>

<p><b>ETA:</b> Carlsson says he doesn't know more than what's in his new paper (which mentions that the two complexes are the same for L<sub>∞</sub> spaces), and he should know. And <a href="http://3dpancakes.typepad.com/ernie/2007/09/life-small-hole.html">Jeff has put his talk slides up</a>.</p>

Hmmm. An easy extension of the alpha-complex idea?

Um, the Čech complex is, sort of. At least, both the Čech complex and the alpha-complex involve sorting tuples of points by circumradius, although the Čech complex allows all tuples, even those of more than (d+1) points while the alpha-complex restricts to tuples that come from the Delaunay triangulation, and the Čech complex is more usually thought of as fixed at some specific scale parameter while the alpha-complex is I think more thought of as a sequence graded by scale. I'm not sure what insight the alpha-complex has for Vietoris–Rips complexes, though.

<p>I was a little confused about the point in your article regarding Cech complexes, because I understood your definition to refer to balls within M itself, which I would think would be a perfectly valid (if often uninteresting) definition; why then would the containing space matter?  Shouldn't even the definition of a Cech complex of M refer to the metric space containing M, a Cech complex of M "relative to" M' containing M, or something?</p>

<p>Probably the wording could be made more clear. I don't know if there's a commonly used shorthand for "the Čech complex of the set of δ-balls centered at points of X in a space Y ⊃ X", though.</p>

<p>The point I was trying to make is, I think, the same one you're expressing: specifying M and δ alone is not enough to determine "the Čech complex" because for that complex it matters in what space M is embedded.</p>

<p>I think the actual definition of Čech complex is just that you start with a family of sets and form a simplex for every finite subfamily that has a common intersection. The balls aren't really part of the definition, they just come in as the most likely sets to use to relate Čech complexes to Vietoris–Rips complexes.</p>
