<a href="http://calitics.com/diary/9872/private-postsecondary-institutions-need-oversight-now">California&#x27;s legislature is attempting to pass regulations on private colleges</a> and other postsecondary institutions, after a previous attempt was vetoed by the governor. In other news, postsecondary education in California is apparently now completely unregulated after a 2007 law on the subject expired.

According to <a href="http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/09-10/bill/asm/ab_0001-0050/ab_48_bill_20090723_amended_sen_v93.html">the latest draft</a>, this would have no affect on accredited institutions (which are explicitly exempted) but is intended to set minimum standards of teaching quality and programmatic stability for diploma mills and other unaccredited institutions.
