An <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Series_parallel_composition.svg">illustration of series-parallel graph composition operations</a> that I drew has made the main page of Wikipedia, as a tiny thumbnail in the &quot;did you know?&quot; column for today. If I&#x27;d known that would happen I would have paid more attention to the composition rather than just trying to get it all to fit neatly into a rectangle.

This is actually a pretty good illustration.  If you really wanted, you could definitely improve it, but I think the fact that it looked pretty good without twiddling was one of the reasons it made it into Wikipedia.

Thanks! We&#x27;re often our own biggest critics, I guess.
