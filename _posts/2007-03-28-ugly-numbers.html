<a href="http://www.mymathforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=2848">Yet another name for regular numbers / Hamming numbers / 5-smooth numbers</a>. I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re ugly, but arun apparently does.

I think they are rather nice.   I&#x27;d leave a message for him on his blog to give him the &quot;algorithm&quot; that I use, but who wants to create a new login on every blog just to respond.   Instead, I&#x27;ll just leave it here.

It&#x27;s at the bottom of this recent post of mine having to do with sexagesimal numbers.

Thanks for the link! My own code for the problem is <a href="http://11011110.livejournal.com/95196.html">on this earlier post</a>. See also the links livejournal user leonardo_m left there; it&#x27;s quite a famous and well-studied problem in functional programming circles. Since your post is partly about multiplying and dividing sexagesimals, you might also like <a href="http://11011110.livejournal.com/95519.html">this post</a> if you haven&#x27;t already seen it.
