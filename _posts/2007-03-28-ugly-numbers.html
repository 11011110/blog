<p><a href="http://www.mymathforum.com/viewtopic.php?p=2848">Yet another name for regular numbers / Hamming numbers / 5-smooth numbers</a>. I don't think they're ugly, but arun apparently does.</p>

<p>I think they are rather nice.   I'd leave a message for him on his blog to give him the "algorithm" that I use, but who wants to create a new login on every blog just to respond.   Instead, I'll just leave it here.</p>

<p>It's at the bottom of this recent post of mine having to do with sexagesimal numbers.</p>

<p>Thanks for the link! My own code for the problem is <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/2007/03/12/hammings-problem.html">on this earlier post</a>. See also the links livejournal user leonardo_m left there; it's quite a famous and well-studied problem in functional programming circles. Since your post is partly about multiplying and dividing sexagesimals, you might also like <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/2007/03/18/range-restricted-hamming-problem.html">this post</a> if you haven't already seen it.</p>
