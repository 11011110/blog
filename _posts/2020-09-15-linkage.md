* [Closed quasigeodesics on the dodecahedron](https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematicians-report-new-discovery-about-the-dodecahedron-20200831/) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/104785420838924796)), paths that start at a vertex and go straight across each edge until coming back to the same vertex from the other side. Original paper, [arXiv:1811.04131](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04131), [doi:10.1080/10586458.2020.1712564](https://doi.org/10.1080/10586458.2020.1712564). I saw this on Numberphile a few months back (video linked in article) but now it's on _Quanta_.

* [Lorenz Stöer's geometric landscapes](https://blog.graphicine.com/lorenz-stoer-geometric-landscapes/) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/104799765760054680)). [In 2014 I linked a different page]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2014-09-30-linkage-for-end %}) with a few of Stöer's 16th-century proto-surrealist combinations of landscape and geometry, but they were black and white. This one has more of them, in color.

* [Ideal polyhedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_polyhedron), a polyhedron in hyperbolic space with all vertices at infinity, and [Sylvester–Gallai theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvester%E2%80%93Gallai_theorem), that every finite set of points in the Euclidean plane has a line that either passes through all of them or through exactly two of them. Both newly promoted to Good Article status on Wikipedia ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/104803212564257211)).

* [Escherian wiener-dog Cerberus fetches three impossible things](https://merveilles.town/@neauoire/104779168858836970).

* Flamebait post of the day: [Why mathematicians should stop naming things after each other](http://nautil.us/issue/89/the-dark-side/why-mathematicians-should-stop-naming-things-after-each-other) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/104813883920721252), [via](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24385389)).  For once the via-link discussion is worth reading (main point: the alternative, using common English words to describe specialized technical concepts, can be even more confusing).

* Early Renaissance painter Piero della Francesca was also an accomplished mathematician, and his book on polyhedra, _De quinque corporibus regularibus_ (subject of a [new Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_quinque_corporibus_regularibus); [$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/104820183749646319)) has an interesting history that deserves to be better known. Rediscovery of the mathematics of Archimedes! "First full-blown case of plagiarism in the history of mathematics" (by Luca Pacioli, in Divina proportione)! Maybe owned by John Dee! Long lost and found centuries later in the Vatican Library!

* [Peter Cameron gives a nice roundup of two recent online conferences on group theory and combinatorics](https://cameroncounts.wordpress.com/2020/08/30/moonlighting/) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/104833470202099899)) that he attended more-or-less simultaneously, something that would have been impossible for physical conferences. The parts on synchronizing automata and twin-width particularly caught my attention as stuff I should look up and find out more about.

* [An hourglass that demonstrates Archimedes’ theorem that the volume of a cylinder is the sum of the volumes of its inscribed sphere and cone](https://twitter.com/RodBogart/status/455123609195802624) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@mjd/104836143207567957)), from Rod Bogart's twitter feed.

* The [hexagon-minimizing simple bipartite polyhedra of my recent blog post]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2020-09-07-eberhards-theorem-bipartite %}) make nice shapes when converted to [simple orthogonal polyhedra](https://arxiv.org/abs/0912.0537) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/104842837266010559)): a squared-off amphitheater with L-shaped terraces of increasing length as they rise, or a diagonal staircase with congruent L-shaped steps. In each case the outer $$2n$$-gon is the underside of the polygon and the inner cycles are the horizontal faces.

* [Open is not forever: a study of vanished open access journals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11933) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/104850663521092974), [via](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24422593), [via](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/09/dozens-scientific-journals-have-vanished-internet-and-no-one-preserved-them)). This study shows the need for systematic archiving and redundant copying of online open journals, but I suspect that the problem for small hand-run print-based journals without much library pickup might be much worse.

* [A prickly structure made of 70,000 reusable hexapod particles](https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2018/10/a-prickly-structure-made-of-70000-reusable-hexapod-particles/) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/104856358909259046)). Sort of like those [seawalls they build by jumbling together giant concrete caltrops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrapod_(structure)), only with pieces that are not quite so big and with usable spaces left void within it. Sometimes the article says "hexapod" and sometimes "decapod"; the pictures appear to show structures that mix two different kinds of particle.

* _[Combinatorial Theory](http://math.sfsu.edu/beck/ct/board.php)_ ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@bremner/104859257534118058), [see also](https://twitter.com/wtgowers/status/1305253478047068160)), a new open-access combinatorics journal formed from the mass resignation of the Elsevier _JCTA_ editorial board.

* [Trump officials are now telling their supporters to buy guns and ammunition to use against scientists for being anti-Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/14/us/caputo-virus.html). [No, seriously](https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/516319-top-hhs-official-accuses-scientists-of-plotting-against-trump-tells) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/104865069277930004)).

* _[Origametry: Mathematical Methods in Paper Folding](https://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/mathematics/recreational-mathematics/origametry-mathematical-methods-paper-folding)_ ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/104870325812873444)), new book coming out October 31 by Tom Hull. I haven't seen anything more than the blurb linked here and the [limited preview on Google Books](https://books.google.com/books?id=LdX7DwAAQBAJ), but it looks interesting and worth waiting for.
