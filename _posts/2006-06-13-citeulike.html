<p>Via <a href="http://dabacon.org/pontiff/?p=1263">Dave Bacon</a>: <a href="http://www.citeulike.org/">CiteULike</a>. Web site for tagging, rating, and sharing recommendations for academic papers, sort of like del.icio.us.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.citeulike.org/author/Eppstein">Has a few of my papers</a>, <a href="http://www.citeulike.org/tag/computational-geometry">but among all authors only a handful of papers tagged as computational geometry</a>. Doesn't seem to be great at aggregating duplicates; at least, among their somewhat random looking sample of 18 of my papers, one has two entries with different links. Can generate bibtex from its citations; when I tried it from the computational geometry listing the results were only mildly malformed (used @proceedings for one paper when it should have been @inproceedings, and journal instead of booktitle within that entry), much better than Citeseer's.</p>
