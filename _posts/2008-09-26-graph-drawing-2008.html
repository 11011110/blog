<p>I'm back from Graph Drawing 2008 in Crete, and too jet-lagged to blog coherently about it, other than to say that on the whole it went well -- interesting talks, too much tasty seafood and raki (though the lack of beverages at the lunches, similarly to WADS 07, was a minor annoyance), a spectacular location (which I somehow failed to take any photos of, but there should eventually be plenty of others <a href="http://gd2008.org/photos/index.html">on the conference site</a>), good company, and even some progress on the research problems I was thinking about during the conference.</p>

<p>My own talk slides are now online: <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/Epp-GD-08-xyz.pdf">The topology of bendless three-dimensional orthogonal graph drawing</a> and <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/Epp-GD-08-diamonds.pdf">Isometric diamond subgraphs</a>.</p>
