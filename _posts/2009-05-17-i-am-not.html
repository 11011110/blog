Apparently any email containing a URL to this journal (http://11011110.livejournal.com), even as plain text, is being interpreted as &quot;URL Obfuscation&quot; by the AT&amp;T Research email servers, and permanently blocked. I haven&#x27;t done enough experiments to tell whether they don&#x27;t like any URLs, or just not mine, but my guess is that it has something to do with the purely-numeric domain name component.

Moving your username to the dns address was a pay feature, and a pretty neat one, I&#x27;d say. But about 5 years ago, someone found a browser flaw where a special custom layout could capture the authentication cookie and impersonate with it. A substantial number of LJ&#x27;s were hijacked, and an immediate fix was to switch to the dns addressing for everyone, so Brad did that.

Yes, this sounds vaguely familiar. I just checked; I still have posts from 2005 using the old URL syntax. Will try that the next time I want to get a message through.

According to WolframAlpha you are indeed not a number, but two places 9353 km apart.

Cute. I didn&#x27;t know my first name was a place.
