My daughter and three of her friends have been working hard this year to earn the Girl Scouts&#x27; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Award_(Girl_Scouts_of_the_USA)">Silver Award</a>, and this weekend their troop held the award ceremony for them, complete with certificates signed by the governator. <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/silver/index.html">Photos here</a>.

The photo link is pointing to a local (for you) copy of the pictures.

By the way, those scouts are beginning to look rather grown up!  Just curious, at what age do girls finish with scouting, or start dropping out because it is no longer &quot;cool&quot;?

Oops, fixed.

This is a Cadette troop, meaning middle school or roughly ages 12-14. There is some attrition all along, but there is another level of scouting roughly corresponding to high school.
