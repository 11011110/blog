title:  'SODA DOI'

Am I the only one who finds it annoying that papers from SODA (I think some readers may not be algorithms researchers, so: the annual ACM–SIAM Symposia on Discrete Algorithms) don&#x27;t seem to have &quot;real&quot; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier">DOIs</a>?
<br />

<br />
For instance, Agarwal and Matoušek&#x27;s paper on relative neighborhood graphs from SODA 1992 can be reached via <a href="http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/139404.139416">http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/139404.139416</a>, but the ACM portal page one reaches via that link doesn&#x27;t list it as having a DOI, and if one tries instead the centralized DOI server <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/139404.139416">http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/139404.139416</a> it returns an error saying that the DOI cannot be found in their database.
<br />

<br />
This inconsistency between the two DOI servers undermines the integrity of DOIs and the lack of a robustly working DOI for these papers makes it difficult for me to give a permanent link (as opposed to a URL, which could change) to their official versions.

That does seem a bit disturbing.

However, that doesn&#x27;t seem like a &quot;not a real DOI&quot; problem, since DOIs are assigned by whoever owns the prefix -- which, in the case of 10.1145, is the ACM.  The problem seems more likely to be that it&#x27;s not properly registered in the system; c.f. http://www.crossref.org/DOIComplaint/, which also looks like a good place to report the problem.

Also, given that (from what I can tell) the fees are on basis of getting the 10.1145 number, not on registering DOIs under it, there&#x27;s no reason ACM shouldn&#x27;t be registering these.

ACM registers the papers from their other conferences with no problems, but consistently doesn&#x27;t for SODA, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s just an oversight. Maybe it&#x27;s something to do with the conference being sponsored jointly between two different organizations, so the papers aren&#x27;t really theirs alone to assign DOIs to?

Huh.  Regardless, it seems wrong that they would assign them DOIs and not register them.  And, as Crossref&#x27;s complaint site implies, this affects the integrity of the DOI System and thus is a rather big deal.

lame. I wonder why this is, and whether it happens for other conferences. /makes note to check

DOIs are assigned by owner of the publication. SIAM publishes SODA proceedings and is responsible for DOI assignment. I believe SIAM only has the last few years of SODA online. ACM cannot assign DOIs to SIAM publications.

Ok, but that doesn&#x27;t explain why ACM has sort-of-working unassigned DOIs for the papers, and why SIAM doesn&#x27;t (as far as I know) assign DOIs for them despite allowing ACM to provide the online hosting for them.
