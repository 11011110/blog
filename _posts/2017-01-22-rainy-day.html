<p>The view out my back door this afternoon:</p>

<p align="center"><img src="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/rainytrellis/RainyTrellis-m.jpg" border="2" style="border-color:black;"></p>

<p>I'm pretty sure the white hair-like things in the background are raindrops, motion-blurred into streaks.</p>

<p>I just replaced my laptop (the old one's keyboard and trackpad were dying), so if the colors are off or different from before, that's why. Also much fussing with Python ensued to get my old gallery-creation script running again, since the brain transplant didn't include any libraries I might have been depending on, and the versions I could figure out how to install in their place had a slightly different API. I'm just glad my old copy of Photoshop still runs and I don't have to switch to the subscription model or find an alternative.</p>
