I just found out via the <a href="http://www.math.nyu.edu/~pach/combin_seminar/fall_2005/varon092105abs.ps">NYU seminar announcement</a> that the empty hexagon problem has finally been solved — any sufficiently large point set in general position has six points that form the vertices of a hexagon without other points inside it.  A similar result was known for pentagons, and known to be impossible for heptagons — there are infinite point sets without empty heptagons.  Anyone know where to track down more details?  Googling &quot;Gerken hexagon&quot; didn&#x27;t find anything useful, just a couple more talk announcements.

ETA: Apparently the basic idea is to start with nine points in convex position (known from Erdős &amp; Szekeres to exist in large enough point sets) and then proceed by messy case analysis.  <a href="http://geomblog.blogspot.com/2005/09/holes-in-sets-conclusion.html">Suresh has a little more</a>.
