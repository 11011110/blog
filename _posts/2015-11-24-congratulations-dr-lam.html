Jenny Lam, my teaching assistant for algorithms this quarter, passed today her thesis defense. She has been working with Sandy Irani, primarily on online algorithms for replacement and memory management strategies in heterogeneous caches (such as web proxies that have to maintain copies of documents of widely varying sizes), and has three papers on that subject, one at ALENEX and two at Middleware. She also has another paper on security-related algorithms in submission, which I&#x27;m also a co-author on. My understanding is that she will be teaching next semester at Pomona College on a temporary basis, while she looks for a more permanent position. Congratulations!
