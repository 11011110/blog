As usual for the holidays, I visited my parents in Mendocino and my in-laws in Palo Alto. It&#x27;s odd how sometimes the things I think about are caught up in location: I was working on one problem in Palo Alto, completely forgot about it while I was in Mendocino, and returned to it anew once I returned to Palo Alto.
<br />

<br />
Photos now online from <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/kai3bd/index.html">my wife&#x27;s cousin&#x27;s son&#x27;s birthday</a> (colors a little wonky, probably only of interest to relatives, but they came out better than I thought they had) and <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/mck07/index.html">New Years Eve at MacKerricher State Park</a>. It was cold and windy; we didn&#x27;t stay long, and later caught the very pretty tail end of the sunset (and some very good seafood pasta) at Sharon&#x27;s in Noyo Harbor. I tried cropping some of these 2:1, even wider than the 16:9 aspect ratio that I usually crop panoramic shots; I think it works well for this subject.

can&#x27;t get over it.  And I&#x27;ve known your journal for it&#x27;s past beautiful pictures -besides all these things and graphics that seem quite interesting- but this one swallowed me. It&#x27;s the ocean, ok, but is it clouds, or a rugged set of mountain strips? also how can it resemble 2 directly oposite extremes? How hilarious and freeing, thanx very much
