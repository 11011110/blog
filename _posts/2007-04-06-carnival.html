<a href="http://scienceandreason.blogspot.com/2007/04/carnival-of-mathematics-ordinal-5.html">Fifth Carnival of Mathematics</a>, now up at Science and Reason. More focused on recent mathematical news (Paul Cohen, medieval islamic Penrose tiles, and E<sub>8</sub>) and less on a catch-all of popular math blog posts than previous carnivals, but it still has some of the latter type of posts as well.
