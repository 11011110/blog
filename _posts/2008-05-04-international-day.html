The local girl scouts held their annual International Day event this weekend. Each troop gets assigned a different country; they all dress up in their idea of a national costume, set up pavilions in a big square, parade around the square, and then sell food samples to each other and to their parents and siblings for a dime apiece from their pavilions. My daughter&#x27;s troop ended up with Indonesia; for their costumes they all wore sarongs (with whatever tops they felt like) and for their food samples they sold klepon, sweet coconut rice-flour -dough balls stuffed with palm sugar and tasting sort of like coconut mochi. A good time was had by all, I think. <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/iday08/index.html">Photos here</a>.

This was my fifth International Day; photos from past years&#x27; events are <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/iday/index.html">here</a>, <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/iday04/index.html">here</a>, <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/iday05/index.html">here</a>, and <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/iday06/index.html">here</a>.

On the subject of photography, I finally decided my old D60 was getting tired and replaced it with a Canon 40D, so this weekend&#x27;s photos may be the last batch from the old camera. The newer one has 60% more pixels, 60% more light-gathering ability, twice the burst rate, and much better autofocus (the D60&#x27;s weakest point). I chose a package that also included Canon&#x27;s 17-85 kit lens; when I can do so, I&#x27;d rather use primes or my 70-200IS, as I&#x27;m sure the optical quality on the 17-85 isn&#x27;t quite as good and it won&#x27;t open as wide, but it should make a very good travel lens.

Lens is fairly low weight and small, but yeah optical quality is not it&#x27;s strongest feature. I used it on my 400D on a conference trip to Singapore, found it usefull but fairly dark. Now I am using Tammy 28-75 and am much happier B-)

Thanks. The most attractive feature of this lens for me was the wide angles; 28-75 wouldn&#x27;t do that unless I went to a much more expensive body.
