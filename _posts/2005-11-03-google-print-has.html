The first story I&#x27;ve seen about successful use of Google Print, and it&#x27;s a recreational geometry book.  <a href="http://origomi.blogspot.com/2005/11/google-print-shows-me-interesting-book.html">Eric Gjerde used Google Print to find Greg Frederickson&#x27;s book <i>Hinged Dissections: Swinging and Twisting</i></a>.  He writes: &quot;I can honestly say I would never have found this book if it was not indexed in Google Print. &quot;

ETA: <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/46368">Metafilter thread on Google Print</a>. Most of which seems to be comments of the form &quot;this looks neat, why would you want to stop them from doing that?&quot;
