I recently returned from a trip to Europe, with a one-day stopover in Rome, a visit to La Maddalena (a small resort island between Sardinia and Corsica) for [FUN 2018](https://sites.google.com/view/fun2018/), another stopover in Copenhagen, and a visit to Malm√∂, Sweden, for [SWAT 2018](http://csconferences.mah.se/swat2018/index.html). I'm still processing photos, but [the first batch, from La Maddalena](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/lamaddalena/), is now up.

Despite being annoying to get to (an hour's drive and another half-hour ferry ride from the nearest minor airport), La Maddalena is a very pleasant place to hold a conference, with a beautiful coastline and great food. The hotel was a little quirky (for instance, no potable water in the taps) and just enough inland to not have an ocean view, but it was still comfortable enough. Here's what I could see from my hotel room:

You might notice the little triangular patio table on the balcony. Like [several other kinds of rounded triangle]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2018-04-17-mythical-reuleaux-manhole %}), this is not a Reuleaux triangle, even if one ignores the rounded-off corners. On a Reuleaux triangle, the tangents to the two circular arcs that meet at a vertex would form $$120^\circ$$ angles; here, the angle seems somewhat acute. And the distance from corner to corner is noticably larger than the distance from a corner to the middle of the opposite side. It's clearer in a top view:

Notice how much more room there is on the top and bottom margins of the square frame than on the left and right. I've superimposed a circular triangle with right-angled corners (also not Reuleaux) to show that the sides of the table are even a little bit straighter than the superimposed triangle. I'm not sure whether they're circular arcs or some other curve, but if they are circular I'd guess they span only about a $$20^\circ$$ arc, compared to $$30^\circ$$ for the superimposed triangle.

[The rest of the gallery](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/lamaddalena/) is less about furniture geometry and more about pretty views, so check it out. The one below is from the end of the conference excursion, a boat trip to some nearby islands.
