<p>My paper for <a href="http://www.dsi.unive.it/~fun2012/">FUN 2012</a>, "Solving Single-digit Sudoku Subproblems", is now on arXiv.org as <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.5074">arXiv:1202.5074</a>.</p>

<p>In it, I revisited a problem I'd looked at earlier in <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/2005/10/05/single-digit-sudoku-rules.html">a blog post from 2005</a>, in which you want to make deductions about a Sudoku puzzle by looking only at the candidate locations of a single digit at a time. In that blog post, I showed that this kind of deduction is NP-hard to make optimally, which is why I had resorted to heuristics that never make incorrect deductions but that might fail to make some correct deductions. In my new paper, I describe an exponential-time algorithm that finds all possible correct deductions and takes time \( o(2^n) \) on \( n\times n \) Sudoku puzzles. That's fast enough to be very practical for \( 9\times 9 \) and \( 16\times 16 \) Sudoku and makes the heuristics unnecessary.</p>

<p>By this point there's a large body of work on exact exponential time algorithms for NP-hard problems (mostly graph algorithms), and also a large body of work on the <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/cgt/hard.html">computational complexity of combinatorial games and puzzles</a> showing that they give rise to NP-hard problems. What I haven't seen much of is work like my new paper that puts these two together and does worst-case analysis of algorithms for exactly solving games and puzzles. So I think there may be a lot of low-hanging fruit in this direction.</p>

<p>This wasn't just a theoretical exercise, by the way: I implemented my new algorithm and included it in the Sudoku software included as part of my <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/PADS/">PADS</a> library of Python algorithm implementations. Relatedly, because of <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/2012/02/19/version-control.html">my migration from CVS to Git</a>, PADS has a new distribution mechanism: rather than downloading a tarball, you can get it by cloning a Git repository. See <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/PADS/ABOUT-PADS.txt">the README file</a> for details.</p>
