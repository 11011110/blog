Another recently-opened math blog: <a href="http://blogs.williams.edu/Morgan/">Frank Morgan</a>. As <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Morgan_(mathematician)">his Wikipedia article states</a>, Morgan is a professor at Williams College, known for proving the <a href="http://www.maa.org/features/mathchat/mathchat_3_18_00.html">double bubble conjecture</a>: if one forms a soap-bubble configuration with two interior cells of given volumes, the way to do it with minimum surface area is the way you see real soap bubbles do it: three spherical patches meeting at 120-degree angles at a common circle. His blog has recent posts on <a href="http://blogs.williams.edu/Morgan/2008/12/02/p-vs-np-most-important-open-math-question/">whether P vs NP is the most important open question in mathematics</a>, <a href="http://blogs.williams.edu/Morgan/2008/10/26/judging-beauty-by-math/">using the Golden ratio to judge facial beauty</a>, <a href="http://blogs.williams.edu/Morgan/2008/11/21/isoperimetric-sequences/">integer sequences with specified sums and few gaps</a>, and many other varied mathematical topics.

I had him for a few classes at Williams and he is definitely one of the smartest people I&#x27;ve ever been around. But completely and absolutely accessible (as opposed to a total jerk like some of the other genius profs there).

The two main things I remember him for were his unending childlike enthusiasm for things he&#x27;s clearly taught over and over for years, and the fact that he could memorize an entire classroom of names on the first day of class, with details about us as well (although from personal experience, I would say the details are actually what would help the mapping).

He also tended to jump up on desks a lot.

He&#x27;s a lot like having a genius 8 year old on crack in the room in that respect - I never felt caffeinated enough in his classes.
