<p>I guess it's been long enough since the Wave collapse, the Reader closure, and the Google news archive elimination, so it's time once again for Google to pick something else that is useful but only to an insufficiently massive subset of its users, and kill it. The latest dead Google baby is Google Notifier, which I've been using to get desktop notifications of new incoming emails. Google's suggested replacement is to enable desktop notifications directly in gmail, but that only works when I have a browser window or tab open to gmail, and I don't like cluttering up my browser with windows or tabs that I'm not actually using.</p>

<p>Oh well, the likely result is only that I'll be slow answering emails, something that is often true anyway. At least they haven't tried to break Google scholar yet.</p>

<p>My fear is that Google scholar can be easily killed. It doesn't bring money, but only enrages publishers.</p>
