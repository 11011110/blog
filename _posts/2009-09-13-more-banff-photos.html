<p>As <a href="{{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2009-08-30-banff-photos %}">promised</a>, I've finally put up <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/dianabanff/index.html">Diana's photos from Banff</a>, complete with grizzly bear.</p>

<p>Much of the delay was due to a chain of reinstallations of software and libraries I needed to perform to get my web photo gallery software working again after upgrading to Snow Leopard. Why doesn't software just work? (Asks the computer scientist, who should know better.)</p>

We didn't keep most of the ones of the horse rears, sadly, so there might not be enough material for a collage of them after all.
