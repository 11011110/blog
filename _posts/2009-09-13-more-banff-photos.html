As <a href="http://11011110.livejournal.com/180108.html">promised</a>, I&#x27;ve finally put up <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/dianabanff/index.html">Diana&#x27;s photos from Banff</a>, complete with grizzle bear.
<br />

<br />
Much of the delay was due to a chain of reinstallations of software and libraries I needed to perform to get my web photo gallery software working again after upgrading to Snow Leopard. Why doesn&#x27;t software just work? (Asks the computer scientist, who should know better.)

We didn&#x27;t keep most of the ones of the horse rears, sadly, so there might not be enough material for a collage of them after all.
