* Here's a photo from the Palais des Congrès de Montréal <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/115059895044777357)),</span> where the SIAM/CAIMS joint meeting was held two weeks ago. The convention center is filled with large-scale artworks, but I found most of them kind of cold and impersonal and corporate. This one usually doesn't even look like art, just a part of the architecture. But caught in the right light and by surprise, it could take you to another space. I hope I managed to convey some of that transformational effect in the image. It's called "[Translucide](https://artpublicmontreal.ca/en/oeuvre/translucide/)" (2002), by Jean-François Cantin, Michel Lemieux, and Victor Pilon.

![In the west foyer of the Palais des Congrès de Montréal, sunlight streams through a wall of rectangular stained glass panels, tiling the floor with trapezoids of color. Through the panels can be seen the trees of Jean-Paul-Riopelle Place, people among the trees, and more buildings behind the trees. A man walks through the foreground in business casual clothes, a tote bag over his shoulder, face turned towards the stained glass wall behind him; his shoes, shoulders, and the top of his head are colored red like the floor below him.](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/pdcm/Translucide-m.jpg){: style="border-style:solid;border-color:black;width:100%;max-width:720px" }

* [An AI-generated bifurcation plot for a dynamical system](https://mathstodon.xyz/@highergeometer/115048715470453622), in an AI-generated arXiv preprint, would be pretty enough as an artistic impression of a plot rather than something mathematically meaningful, if it weren't for the mangled and misplaced axis labels.

* Another newly passed Wikipedia Good Article: [Matroid parity problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matroid_parity_problem) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/115074991156426211)).</span> Matroids generalize independence in linear algebra. If you have any matrix, you can find a basis for its column space by choosing columns greedily, checking only that each chosen column is independent of the others you have already chosen. But in the matroid parity problem, the columns come in pairs and you want to find a maximum independent set of paired columns. Another way to think about this is that each pair of columns defines a two-dimensional space, a plane, and you are trying to find a family of $$k$$ of these planes that spans a full <span style="white-space:nowrap">$$2k$$-dimensional</span> space, for $$k$$ as large as possible.

  Why? See the article for details, but algorithms for this problem have applications including  approximating the largest planar subgraph of a given graph, in finding the highest-genus surface on which a given graph can be embedded, and in pinning into place two-dimensional bar-and-hinge linkages.

This allows each knot or link to be specified by a constant number of bits per spine crossing, specifying which pages the two arcs at that crossing belong to and whether they go up or down in those pages.

The submission deadline is October 6 for abstracts and October 13 for the full papers. I've enjoyed the past LATIN conferences I've gone to; it takes papers from a wide variety of topics in theoretical computer science, and more than many other theory conferences I get the impression that the audience is paying attention and interested.

* [Default search engine: Wikipedia](https://paste.sr.ht/~awal/2310cfca431e9f723df281d02558eaebd77e2091) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/115113643202370872),</span> [via](https://lobste.rs/s/acz07b/default_search_engine_wikipedia)). It used to be the case that Wikipedia's search engine was so weak that I would use Google when I knew that the result I was looking for was a Wikipedia article, and Google would find it. But now the search powers of Google and the like have deteriorated so much (and been taken over by so much AI slop) that, according to Awal, it works better to make your default (not only) search engine be Wikipedia. Which of course leads to the question quis pro quaerentes quaerit: if one is using search to find content to edit Wikipedia, it's not going to work to search for that content on Wikipedia. So in the face of the deterioration of other search engines, where do we go?
