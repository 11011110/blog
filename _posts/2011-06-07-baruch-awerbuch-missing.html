I ran across an <a href="http://beforeitsnews.com/story/684/931/Another_really_bad_thing_happened-_my_first_cousin_disappeared._I_need_help_in_finding_him.html">odd story</a>  today (on a web site not known for its trustworthiness) about well-known algorithm researcher Baruch Awerbuch&#x27;s mysterious disappearance a year or two ago. His <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/a/Awerbuch:Baruch.html">publication record</a> also shuts down at about the same time.
<br />

<br />
I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s an unrelated coincidence, but in retrospect some of his titles start to sound a little sinister: &quot;Collaboration of untrusting peers with changing interests&quot;, &quot;Collaborate with strangers to find own preferences&quot;, &quot;Tell me who I am&quot;.
