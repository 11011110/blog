The <a href="http://2009.eurocg.org/accepted.html">list of acceptances to EuroCG</a> is out.
<br />

<br />
EuroCG isn&#x27;t really a peer-reviewed conference, as I&#x27;ve been told (never having attended one myself): much like the U.S. fall workshop series in computational geometry, they accept almost anything that&#x27;s on-topic, and don&#x27;t have a published proceedings, although there is an online collection of short abstracts. So if you want to find out about something on the list you should go to Brussels in March for the conference or wait for a real version to appear elsewhere.
