The Sunday before <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/2008/09/08/congratulations-dr-mumford.html">Elena&#x27;s defense</a>, I went sightseeing in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterland">Waterland</a> in The Netherlands (more specifically <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marken">Marken</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monnickendam">Monnickendam</a>, followed by a brief visit to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naarden">Naarden</a>) with Marc, Bettina, and Elena. It was very pretty, but very wet. After the ALGO conferences ended today I had time to process my photos, and also threw in some from a later visit to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuenen">Nuenen</a> (birthplace of Van Gogh and the setting for several of his paintings).

SAT is (not) NP-complete
http://arxiv.org/abs/0806.2947
Here is a easy-to-understand for this:
Let L be the Prolog program:
Fact:
Age-About-21(John,0.9).
Goal:
?- Age-About-21(John,0.9).
The Prolog system answers two different contradictory answers:
&quot;Yes&quot; = &quot;1&quot; and &quot;0.9&quot; in the fact.
Try the goal:
?- Age-About-21(John,0.3).
Again, the system answers two contradictory answers:&quot;No&quot; = &quot;0&quot; and &quot;0.9&quot;.
Clearly, this language is in P, but how to reduce it to SAT?
How to reduce instances of the FLP problem whose output is two contradictory truth values to the SAT problem whose output is only one.
It is easy to show that ZFC is inconsistent via 2 (independent) proofs.

77.245.14.116, does your crankery have anything to do with sightseeing in the Netherlands?

Posted by mistake.

I deeply apologize.

Never mind the proof of SAT being (not) NP-complete would render ZFC inconsistent which may indirectly affect lots of things; not just sight-seeing in the Netherlands.

Review the paper, it has several proofs, none of which is about the mathematical foundations of sight-seeing.

Please accept my apologies again.
