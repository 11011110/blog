<p>This past week we went on a little family vacation to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalon,_California">Avalon</a>, an hour's boat ride offshore from us on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Catalina_Island,_California">Catalina Island</a>. <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/avalon/index.html">Here are some photos</a>, including many of the distinctive tilework that decorates the town.</p>

<p>Avalon is a very pretty place.</p>

<p>Did you get to go inside the Casino?  It was closed the weekend I was in Avalon last summer.</p>

<p>No, I didn't. There was some sort of casino tour that we thought about taking, but didn't, and I'm not sure it was even running — the movie theater in the casino was closed for a few days for renovations when we were there, and maybe the rest was, too, I'm not sure.</p>
