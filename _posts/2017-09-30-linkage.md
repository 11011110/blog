* [This year's Graph Drawing contest rules and graphs](http://www.graphdrawing.de/contest2017/challenge.html) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/5y2icm5XQLx)). This year's challenge is over but the graphs are probably still interesting as test data. The G+ post includes an argument that some graphs require sharp crossing angles (this year's optimization criterion).

* [Borromeaanse ringen / Borromean Rings](http://ralphvanraaij.blogspot.nl/2017/04/borromeaanse-ringen-borromean-rings.html) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/EyR9FCmgsxV)). One of many imagined mathematical cityscapes by Ralph van Raaij.

* [ArXiv adds three electrical engineering topic areas](https://arxiv.org/help/eess/announcement) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/5VzFDkmDuH6)), and a few days later another for econometrics.

* [Tur√°n's brick factory problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tur%C3%A1n%27s_brick_factory_problem) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/Y7H4Yc53h1f)). The problem that started the study of crossing numbers of graphs. Now a Good Article on Wikipedia.

* [Thousands of new solutions to the three-body problem](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2148074-infamous-three-body-problem-has-over-a-thousand-new-solutions/) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/EjcB8P75NtP)). It appears from [the preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04775) that these supposed new periodic orbits have only been determined numerically, and have not been verified to exist with rigorous mathematics.

* [The female scientists and technologists on the ceiling of Grand Central Station](https://www.forbes.com/sites/hilarybrueck/2017/09/20/grand-central-ceiling-women-in-science-and-stem-ge-millie-dresselhaus/) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/iWqyhaYsQ6G)).

* [Accepting the state of being stuck](https://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2017/09/20/the-state-of-being-stuck/) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/DT3GzMfcquu)). Andrew Wiles' advice for success in mathematical research.

* [Algorithmically designed bobbin lace by Veronika Irvine](https://tesselace.com/gallery/) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/RZRdKFaafPv)). See [her Graph Drawing paper with Therese Biedl](http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.09778) for more on the mathematics behind this mathematical textile art.

* [View-Master Dog](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/vmdog/index.html) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/1D2kkHcvKZr)), the unofficial mascot of Graph Drawing 2017.

* [Graph Drawing contest winners](https://plus.google.com/100372006947364662364/posts/5VV3yrD4SBb) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/ZfiGvFKkuhZ)). The link describes an interactive visualization of a citation network. But the outcome of the online part of the contest is that optimizing crossing angles above all else leads to bad drawings.

* [The economics of diamond open access](https://blogs.harvard.edu/pamphlet/2012/03/06/an-efficient-journal/) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/QVax5u2km26)). With ineffective paid-publisher shill in the comments.

* [When open-access whitelists fail](http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/ugcs-approved-journal-list-has-111-more-predatory-journals/article19677830.ece) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/LivfL6iELXo), [via](http://retractionwatch.com/2017/09/23/weekend-reads-sexual-harassment-scientific-misconduct-says-one-society-favorite-plagiarism-excuses/)). Somehow over a hundred predatory journals made their way onto an Indian approved-journal list. But even DOAJ-listed journals accepted a bad test paper in nearly half of the instances of one test.
