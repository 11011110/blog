<p>SODA PC chair Phil Klein asked me to publicize this quick announcement because of delays in getting this information online in a more official way: for next January's <a href="http://siam.org/meetings/da17/">SODA (ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms) in Barcelona</a>, the submission deadlines will be July 6 (short abstract and paper registration) and July 13 (full submission).</p>

<p>For now, you can visit <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~pnk/#soda17">http://cs.brown.edu/~pnk/#soda17</a> for the basic information (deadlines, submission site, and program committee).</p>
