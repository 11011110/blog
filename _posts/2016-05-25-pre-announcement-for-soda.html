SODA PC chair Phil Klein asked me to publicize this quick announcement because of delays in getting this information online in a more official way: for next January&#x27;s <a href="http://siam.org/meetings/da17/">SODA (ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms) in Barcelona</a>, the submission deadlines will be July 6 (short abstract and paper registration) and July 13 (full submission).
<br />

<br />
For now, you can visit http://cs.brown.edu/~pnk/#soda17 for the basic information (deadlines, submission site, and program committee).ï»¿
