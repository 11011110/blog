<p>As many others have already posted, the list of STOC accepted papers (without abstracts, sadly) is out. See <a href="http://kintali.wordpress.com/2010/02/09/stoc2010/">Kintali</a> for pointers to online versions of some of the papers.</p>

<p>Also, the <a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/focs2010/">FOCS 2010</a> call for papers is now available. Papers are due April 7; there is no page limit for submissions, though there will be one (unspecified as for now) in the proceedings. There does not appear to be any one-week-ahead-of-time pre-extended-abstract abstract submission process, just one deadline for everything. I was also pleased to see an explicit encouragement to the authors to make their full papers available online on one of the major preprint servers.</p>
