<p>Continuing to go through and clean up some of my old bookmark collections, I found one on cartography and mapmaking.  Maps and atlases have always fascinated me, and my son seems to have inherited my interest; in graduate school, I decorated my apartment with maps instead of posters.  Nowadays, if I want a quick map of how to get to some location, I tend to go directly to <a href="http://maps.google.com/">Google Maps</a>, and I&#x27;ve also had fun scanning the satellite imagery there and at <a href="http://www.terraserver.com/">TerraServer</a>.  Doing an interest search here found <b><a href="http://cartographica.livejournal.com/"><img src="http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif" alt="[info]" width="17" height="17" style="vertical-align: bottom; border: 0;" />cartographica</a></b>, which looks like it should be fascinating to follow. Here are a few other more specialized mapping sites:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.loc.gov/rr/geogmap/gmpage.html">The Library of Congress Map Room</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/english/htmain.htm">The United Nations Cartographic Section</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.mcwetboy.net/maproom/">The Map Room weblog</a></li>

<li><a href="http://www.research.att.com/~suresh/cartogram/">Suresh&#x27;s Election 2004 cartograms</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And, just for fun (I think <a href="http://cartome.org/">cartome</a> can stand the hotlink):</p>

there is a very cool plugin for firefox that allows you to fill out an address in (say) google maps and then view the same viewpoint (lat/long) in a host of other mappinng systems:

The blog http://googlemapsmania.blogspot.com/ is a treasure trove of google maps  mashups as well.

Looks cool, but I usually use Safari; is there a web-based version, or can it only be used as a browser plugin, do you know?  I&#x27;ll have to check out the blogspot thing.  Thanks for the pointers.
