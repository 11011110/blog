Some recent email (asking me for advice on getting started at Wikipedia) prompted me to write a short essay on how and more importantly why researchers should become involved in Wikipedia editing. You can find it at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_editing_for_research_scientists">Wikipedia:Wikipedia editing for research scientists</a>.

It&#x27;s a nice overview of the distinct aspects of editing Wikipedia (which differ from academic writing), and it provides several pointers to help an &quot;academic&quot; quickly become a productive editor. It&#x27;s clear that going forward Wikipedia will need more expert editors so that it can reach a greater &quot;depth&quot; (especially in technical areas).

Thanks! And thanks for the edits to the essay. I hope this ends up luring some more long-term contributors and not just being a nice essay, but it seems likely to be difficult to measure that.

It&#x27;s unfortunate that there&#x27;s no way to measure the &quot;impact&quot; that one&#x27;s contributions to Wikipedia have on the learning/research of others. When I want to know more about a topic that&#x27;s new to me, Wikipedia is usually a first stop before I start digging through a textbook or google scholar results. And I&#x27;m sure many (most?) others do the same.

Editing Wikipedia is mostly an altruistic act for academics (and others for that matter). There&#x27;s no glory in it, but it does give me a &quot;warm fuzzy&quot; feeling when I make an improvement to an article.

Maybe &quot;warm fuzzy feeling&quot; should be added to the &quot;Why?&quot; section! :-) (Although, it&#x27;s probably covered by &quot;Public service&quot;.)

My biggest worry about seriously contributing to the Wikipedia is: How do I know one day someone won&#x27;t do something &quot;bad&quot; to my articles? Do I have to keep watch on them indefinitely?

Keeping watch on articles you&#x27;ve edited is a good idea, but it&#x27;s not necessary: I think most articles have several people watching them, so if one drops out there are others who will notice any problems.
