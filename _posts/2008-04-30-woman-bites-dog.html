In a turnaround from the usual story about a bad student threatening legal action against all the faculty who dare to assess the student as bad, a Dartmouth writing lecturer is threatening to sue her students (and some faculty, and Dartmouth itself) for discrimination. There are too many different postings to link to them all here, but there&#x27;s a pretty thorough roundup at <a href="http://www.journalfen.net/community/otf_wank/596858.html">this post</a>.
<br />

<br />
The claimed cause for the lawsuits is harassment but, as <a href="http://www.dartblog.com/data/2008/04/007755.php">this story notes</a>, that is not covered by the title under which the lecturer is threatening to sue.
<br />

<br />
One familiar name in all this is that of Tom Cormen, Dartmouth algorithms guru (and writing program director), mentioned in <a href="http://www.dartblog.com/data/2008/04/007756.php">this interview</a> as having committed the heinous crimes of (1) interrupting classes he was sitting in on, and (2) NOT interrupting the classes he was sitting in on when he stepped out of them.
