<a href="http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/org/daily/2007/11/14/orourke-on-geometric-reductionism/">O&#x27;Rourke on Geometric Reductionism</a>. Student newspaper article by Neena Cherayil on a talk by Joe O&#x27;Rourke, “Geometric Folding Algorithms: Linkages, Origami, and Polyhedra,” including a description of the Houdini one-cut trick and segueing into a discussion of whether computational geometry is useful.

O&#x27;Rourke gave a similar (or the same) talk at Colby also. I doubt there was any coverage in the student newspaper there though.
