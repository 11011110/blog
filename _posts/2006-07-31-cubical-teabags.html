Igor Pak has just published a preprint on a cute variant of the <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/teabag.html">teabag problem</a> on the maximum volume of a surface enclosed by two squares joined together at their edges and warped without stretching. Ordinary paper provides a good model of a surface that can be bent and folded but not stretched, so this problem is easy to make physical models for, although the volume calculations or measurements may be difficult.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, in Pak&#x27;s version, he considers a different surface, formed by six squares joined together at their edges: the surface of a unit cube. Of course, these six squares can enclose a cubical region with unit volume. And it&#x27;s easy to dent parts of the cube inwards, to enclose smaller volume. What Pak shows, perhaps surprisingly, is that unit volume is not optimal: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/math.MG/0607754">it&#x27;s possible to bend and fold the faces of a cube, without stretching them, to enclose larger than unit volume</a>. Pak also cites several earlier works on similar problems of which I was unaware.

PS re a different paper also appearing on arXiv tonight: telling me your papers are &quot;not mistake free&quot; is not a good way to persuade me to read them.
