<a href="http://in-theory.blogspot.com/2006/07/what-good-is-olog-n-approximation.html">Luca tries to explain why finding O(logÂ n) approximations could be useful and not just of mathematical interest</a>; the comments head in various more general directions about motivation for doing TCS research, believability of random power-law graph models, how moribund is PRAM algorithmics, etc.
<br />

<br />
Also, Suresh <a href="http://geomblog.blogspot.com/2006/08/musings-on-arxiv.html">ponders the lack of peer-review on arXiv.org</a> in the light of a recent paper claiming to supply a polynomial time graph isomorphism algorithm, and <a href="http://geomblog.blogspot.com/2006/08/timestamping-using-arxiv.html">wonders how seriously self-publication on a web site or archive should be taken in precedence disputes</a>.

Don&#x27;t agree with Suresh on  &quot;Timestamping using the arXiv...&quot;, but that is just a &quot;personal opinion&quot;. Maybe I should comment on his blog, but there have been a few restrictions with Blogger blogs in India: &quot;<a href="http://doctorgero.livejournal.com/16191.html">I thought we are democratic society</a>&quot;. Although I can access his blog, I don&#x27;t want to post/comment anything there, just because our folks don&#x27;t want. One can call it <a href="http://cr.yp.to/djb.html">Bernstein</a> effect, but that is just the way a few people are!

It&#x27;s ok to comment on livejournals but not on blogger blogs? That makes no sense to me...

My experience in China: Blogger was blocked, Livejournal was not. Seems to be the same, elsewhere too. A reason I heard was that some political groups use Blogger for blogging according to their agenda. Stupid idea to block the whole domain because of that...

Anyhow, I&#x27;d enjoy at least Luca (who gets continuous points from be for interesting posts) to move over to Livejournal. :-) He complained at some moment himself that he was not able to read comments on his blogs since he was in China (and he seems to be there constantly).
