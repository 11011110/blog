<p>Went last night to a performance of my daughter&#x27;s middle school vocal ensemble, billed as a dessert and cabaret, at a local church.  Dessert (cheesecake, brownies, and cookies) was served outside; fortunately the thunderstorms we had a couple days ago were past.  A couple flat songs, but mostly very enjoyable.  I took a few photos, <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/vvcab/">now up on my web site</a>; samples:</p>

</tr>
</table></div>

<p>I also shot a few frames of one of my colleagues this morning, for the department web site, but it was on Hudel&#x27;s camera so I don&#x27;t know how they came out.</p>
