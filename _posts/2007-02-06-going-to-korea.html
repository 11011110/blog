<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.CG/0610092">Happy Endings for Flip Graphs</a> was accepted to <a href="http://www.socg.org/2007/">SoCG 2007</a>, as was another paper of mine: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.CG/0603057">Guard Placement For Wireless Localization</a>, with Mike Goodrich and Mike's student Nodari Sitchinava. So I guess that means I'm going to Korea...</p>
