<p>I am really quite curious, sir, as to how you stumbled across my blog.  I certainly enjoy the readership, but I posted the April Fools I've had about twenty times the readership I normally do (yes, that does indeed mean 20 in one single night!  The amazement, the wonder, the. . . pity of it all.)  A good deal of it seems to be from people clicking your links, actually.</p>

<p>In fact, even if you wish to keep the anonymity of whoever sent you that link, thank you for the extra advertisement. :)</p>

<p>It came up in a Google blog search that I have my RSS aggregator run automatically. Probably the one for "geometry" though for some reason I'm not seeing it there any more.
But now that I found it, I added your blog's feed to the aggregator as well...</p>

<blockquote><i>Happy April Fools!</i></blockquote>

<p>To you too!</p>
