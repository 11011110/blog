Among the definitions of pseudolines listed in <a href="http://11011110.livejournal.com/111308.html">my post yesterday</a>, the only one that includes double spirals such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_spiral">Fermats&#x27; spiral</a> is the most general, in which a pseudoline is the image of a line under a homeomorphism of the plane.
<br />

<br />
One can choose among these definitions according to some sense of mathematical elegance: is it preferable to choose the definition that is stated more simply, or the definition that leads to objects that behave more simply? But here&#x27;s a stronger reason why I&#x27;d like to consider double spirals as pseudolines rather than choosing a definition that rules them out.
<br />

<br />
In <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.DS/0406020">one of my papers on drawing media</a>, some of the results concern a duality relationship between weak pseudoline arrangements and zonotopal tilings. A <i>zonotopal tiling</i> is a partition of the plane into polygonal regions, such that each bounded region is a centrally symmetric polygon. If one starts with a zonotopal tiling with finitely many faces, draws curves that connect pairs of opposite edge midpoints of each bounded face of a zonotopal tiling, and then extends each of these curves to infinity in the unbounded faces without introducing any more crossings, the result is a weak pseudoline arrangement drawn as a planar dual to the original tiling. And conversely, any finite weak pseudoline arrangement is combinatorially equivalent to one formed by this construction.
<br />

<br />
I would like to be able to replace the part about &quot;finitely many faces&quot; in this by some local finiteness condition that allows for infinitely many tiles. But it&#x27;s easy to construct locally finite zonotopal tilings that force the dual curves to spiral:
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Therefore, I need a definition that allows such spirals to count as pseudolines.
