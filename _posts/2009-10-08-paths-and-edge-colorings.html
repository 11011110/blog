By way of clearing some space off my whiteboard, here&#x27;s a drawing that&#x27;s been taking up space in the middle of it for too long:
<br />

<br />
<div style="text-align:center"><img src="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/0xDE/EdgeColoredQ6.png" /></div>
<br />

<br />
The context is <a href="http://garden.irmacs.sfu.ca/?q=op/edge_antipodal_colorings_of_cubes">a problem of Norine on edge-antipodal colorings of cubes</a>: is it the case that, whenever the edges of a hypercube are two-colored in such a way that edges directly opposite each other have opposite colors, then some pair of opposite vertices are connected by a path of edges of only one color?
<br />

<br />
I was looking at a stronger variation of the problem: if a cube&#x27;s edges are two-colored arbitrarily, is there always either a monochromatic antipodal path or a monochromatic zone (a family of parallel edges, all given the same color)? If true this would answer Norine&#x27;s problem, because an antipodally colored cube can&#x27;t have a monochromatic zone. But it&#x27;s not true, and the drawing shows why not. It&#x27;s a six-dimensional hypercube (not antipodally colored), in which there are no monochromatic zones (each class of parallel edges has both colors). But there are also no monochromatic antipodal paths: an antipodal path would have to project to an antipodal path in a little three-dimensional cube as well as one in the big three-dimensional cube, but in the little cube the only antipodal paths are brown and in the big one they are only purple.
<br />

<br />
There&#x27;s another variation that I&#x27;ve also thought about, without much success: given an arbitrily two-edge-colored hypercube, must there always exist a path between two opposite vertices in which there exists at most one pair of differently-colored consecutive edges? Norine&#x27;s problem and this problem don&#x27;t require the paths to be shortest paths but that would also be interesting.
