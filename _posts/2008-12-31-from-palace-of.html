<p>Happy New Years, all! We had a fun touristy New Year&#x27;s Eve Day in San Francisco, viewing the Da Vincis at the Legion of Honor and shopping for chocolates at Ghiradelli Square. The Legion of Honor has a great view; it was foggy today but I thought that only gave it more character. <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/loh/index.html">A few photos</a>.</p>
