Via <a href="http://www.journalfen.net/community/fandom_lounge/334771.html">Fandom Lounge</a>: <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060821/ap_on_re_us/university_scandal">OU could strip dozens of engineering masters&#x27; students of their degrees</a> after plagiarized content was found in their theses.

I&#x27;m tempted to get very preachy here but instead let&#x27;s just agree that plagiarism is bad, ok? So don&#x27;t do it.

Plagiarism has never been good at all.  All I know it is stealing and stealing is not a good habit.  But seems to me that most people are still caught up with the idea of getting the work of others to succeed than doing their own work.
