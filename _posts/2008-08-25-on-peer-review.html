<p>...or rather, on <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.3222">what happens when one doesn't have peer review</a>. A representative sentence:</p>

<p><i>It has been previously demonstrated by the present author that the process of converting a decimal number into a binary number can be represented as a form of the 0-1-Knapsack problem, and therefore is NP-Complete.</i></p>

<p>If we can't reject obviously-bad papers from the arxiv, why can't we at least have a special "solutions of P=NP" <s>hell</s> <s>ghetto</s> category to segregate them into?</p>
