...or rather, on <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.3222">what happens when one doesn&#x27;t have peer review</a>. A representative sentence:
<br />

<br />
<i>It has been previously demonstrated by the present author that the process of converting a decimal number into a binary number can be represented as a form of the 0-1-Knapsack problem, and therefore is NP-Complete.</i>
<br />

<br />
If we can&#x27;t reject obviously-bad papers from the arxiv, why can&#x27;t we at least have a special &quot;solutions of P=NP&quot; <s>hell</s> <s>ghetto</s> category to segregate them into?
