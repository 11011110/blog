I&#x27;ve had a couple of past papers in the <a href="http://bioinf.spbau.ru/isvd2013/">International Symposium on Voronoi Diagrams</a>; this year I&#x27;m on the program committee. It will be in St. Petersburg, Russia, in July, during their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Nights_Festival">White Nights festival</a>, so a great time to visit there. Proceedings published by IEEE. <a href="http://bioinf.spbau.ru/isvd2013/call-for-papers">Submission deadline March 20</a>.
