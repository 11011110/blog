A warning, passed along from Phil Klein: if you have any old web pages lying around with URLs pointing to focs.org or focs****.org, you should change them to the links listed in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Symposium_on_Foundations_of_Computer_Science&oldid=287065580">Wikipedia&#x27;s page on FOCS</a>. It seems the .org domains have been taken over by domain-name spammers.
