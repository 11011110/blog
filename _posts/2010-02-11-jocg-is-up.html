<p>As <a href="http://denseoutliers.blogspot.com/2010/02/jocg-first-publications.html">Joachim reports</a>, the <a href="http://jocg.org/index.php/jocg">Journal of Computational Geometry</a> has started publishing its accepted papers.</p>

<p>I hope it's not too inauspicious that <a href="http://jocg.org/index.php/jocg/article/view/21">the first paper</a> has "endings" in its title â€” I wish the journal a long and successful future. Despite the existence of several other commercially-published journals in the same area, I think it's a very good thing that we now have a free and truly open access journal.</p>
