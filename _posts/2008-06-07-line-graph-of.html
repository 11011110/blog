<p>A small followup on <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/2008/06/06/symmetric-embeddings-of.html">yesterday's post</a>:</p>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitruncated_5-cell">bitruncated pentatope</a> is a four-dimensional polytope with ten facets, each in the shape of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated_tetrahedron">truncated tetrahedron</a>. Its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton_(topology)">skeleton</a> (the graph formed by its vertices and edges) is a symmetric graph with 30 vertices, 60 edges, and four edges per vertex. As it turns out, this skeleton is isomorphic to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_graph">line graph</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desargues_graph">Desargues graph</a>.</p>
