On our way back from Mendocino we stopped by the De Young Museum, in San Francisco, to see their Picasso exhibit. If you happen to go there, don&#x27;t miss the sculpture garden (outside the cafe), and if you go to the sculpture garden, don&#x27;t miss <i><a href="http://deyoung.famsf.org/about/james-turrell-three-gems-2005">Three Gems</a></i>, an installation by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Turrell">James Turrell</a> that can be reached by a tunnel hidden in one corner of the sculpture garden. I don&#x27;t think the pictures I&#x27;ve seen (including my own) really do it justice, but it&#x27;s a beautiful quiet contemplative space centered on the interplay of form, color, and the elements.
