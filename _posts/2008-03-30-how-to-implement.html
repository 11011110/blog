A new paper of mine, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0803.4030">Learning sequences</a>, is now available on the arXiv. It&#x27;s intended as a chapter in <i>Knowledge Spaces: Applications in Education</i> (Falmagne, Doble, and Hu, eds., to appear sometime after the rest of the chapters are written) and describes an application in which a computer tests a human student to find a combinatorial description of what the student already knows and what the student is ready to learn.

<br />
If I were aiming it at a different audience, I might equally well have titled it &quot;How to implement an antimatroid&quot;. The main point of the paper, stripped of its computerized education application, is to advocate using a small set of basic words of an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimatroid">antimatroid</a> as a data structure to represent the antimatroid, and to describe how various basic operations such as listing all sets in the antimatroid may be performed efficiently using this data structure.
