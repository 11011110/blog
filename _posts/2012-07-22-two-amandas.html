<p>Last week we saw two shows in L.A.: <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/amandas/index.html">Amanda Ross-Ho at MOCA and Amanda Palmer and the Grand Theft Orchestra at the Roxy in West Hollywood</a>. Both allowed photography, but I didn't keep many shots because the low light conditions led to a lot of unwanted blur. I've put a few remaining photos online at the link above.</p>
