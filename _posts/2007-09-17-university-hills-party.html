My neighborhood association put on a party Sunday, complete with tours of a firefighting helicopter. <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/uh07/">Photos here</a>. Mostly they&#x27;re just snapshots of the local kids having a good time, but they also include a few of my computer science colleagues: <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/uh07/MikeJuniorFirefighter.html">Mike Goodrich</a> (in goofy Junior Firefighter helmet), <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/uh07/Eli.html">Eli Bozorgzadeh</a>, and <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/uh07/Joan.html">Joan</a> <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/uh07/JoanAndMarianne.html">Boyar</a> (visiting UCI from Denmark with her husband Kim Larsen, whom I unfortunately didn&#x27;t get a good shot of).
