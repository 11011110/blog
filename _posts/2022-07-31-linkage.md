Math to Art and Back Again](https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/202207/rnoti-p1220.pdf) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@henryseg/108646207424631021)),</span> article in the _Notices_ by Susan Goldstine, Elizabeth Paley,
and Henry Segerman about the [Mathemalchemy](https://mathemalchemy.org/) traveling multimedia mathematical art installation.

* At [ICGT](https://www.lirmm.fr/icgt-2022/), the "detour problem" in graph algorithms was repeatedly mentioned <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/108672718210680135)):</span> Given vertices $$s$$ and $$t$$ in an unweighted digraph, how hard is it to find an $$s$$–$$t$$ path that is not a shortest path? It's polynomial for planar digraphs [[Fomin et al STACS 2022](https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.STACS.2022.29)] and undirected graphs [[Bezáková et al ICALP 2017](https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.ICALP.2017.54)], and $$\mathsf{NP}$$-hard in the weighted case. But the unweighted problem for arbitrary digraphs remains (annoyingly) open.

And apparently [they are in dependency hell with mathlib](https://leanprover-community.github.io/archive/stream/267928-condensed-mathematics/topic/The.20elephant.20in.20the.20room.html).

Despite the headline, it's not just the antiabortion policies of the red states that are making it hard for their universities to attract good faculty and students; the column also mentions pro-gun, anti-public-health, and anti-LBGTQ policies, and restrictions on the teaching of history.

* Linking to mathstodon.xyz from Wikipedia has been blacklisted, I think for the last two years, as part of a general prohibition on .xyz links as mostly spammy <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/108699308200897184)).</span> I successfully petitioned for it to be whitelisted, and linking has become possible again. I don't recommend this for Wikipedia articles themselves (mathstodon isn't likely to meet Wikipedia's standards for reliable sourcing) but [it could be relevant on some discussion pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Mathematics#Use_of_Latin_in_Mathematics).

* [University and film colleagues mourn death of leading film and television academic Geoff Lealand](https://www.stuff.co.nz/waikato-times/news/129178200/university-and-film-colleagues-mourn-death-of-leading-film-and-television-academic-geoff-lealand) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/108705013752493928)).</span> Geoff was my uncle. Because of the distance from New Zealand to California I didn't see him often, but [I posted briefly from a visit by him in 2013]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2013-04-05-jaffas %}).

This is currently a very hot topic in structural graph theory and parameterized graph algorithms, with at least 25 papers all since 2020. So probably this article will need some updating as more results emerge.

According to the story, university administrators with government ties have been "reprimanding academics for openly speaking out" against the government or against local misadministration, and keeping records of participation in protests, claiming that faculty are subject to more-restrictive rules aimed at other kinds of civil servants.

Why four? Because it is the maximum for generic curves. (In contrast, in 2D generic curves can cross the $$x$$-axis infinitely often.) If you view a curve from far away, most points of view see only simple crossings of two strands, but certain special viewpoints see triple crossings and even-more-special viewpoints see quadruple crossings. Those are the viewpoints on quadrisecants.
