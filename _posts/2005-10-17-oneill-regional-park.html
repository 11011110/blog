<p>I&#x27;m not sure whose brilliant idea it was to have a spontaneous campout in a thunderstorm... Tyler?  Sherri?  Anyway, we got an impressive light show, from a vantage low enough in a canyon that we weren&#x27;t really worried about getting hit, and it didn&#x27;t really pour until we were in the tents.  The weather was a lot clearer in the morning, though it still threatened a little.  Not all the kids were sure they liked the rain, but they got really wired on candy, sang &quot;singing in the rain&quot; really loud, stayed up late talking, spent the morning building bridges in the (dry) bed of Trabuco Creek, had a pow-wow in &quot;the hut&quot; (a sheltered place under a tree), got taken out to the nearest Starbucks on the way out (probably just over the nearest hill as the crow flies, a circuitous mile driving), and then spent the afternoon hanging out together watching a movie.  Not a bad way to spend the last day of fall break...</p>

<p>Anyway, the photos.</p>
