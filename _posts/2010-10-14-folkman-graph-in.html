<p>I've been working on an implementation of the circular layouts of regular graphs from my <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.0579">Lombardi drawing</a> paper, and came across the following really pretty layout of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folkman_graph">Folkman graph</a>, a graph with the curious property that its edges are all symmetric to each other but its vertices aren't. I don't have that much more to say here about the graph, and the software could probably stand to be tested a bit more thoroughly before sharing, but I thought I would at least share the picture:</p>

<p>So I'm not much of an appreciator of graphs. Only a select few graphs have an aesthetic that tickles me - these are usually unique Ramsey graphs with a lot a symmetry (and usually self-complimentary).</p>

<p>Just wanted to drop by to say that this visualization is one of the few that inspired in me an appreciation of graph elegance in the way I imagine a lot of graph/Ramsey theory people must all of the time.</p>

<p>That really is a beautiful and intriguing object!</p>
