Christian Duncan sends me photographic proof that my name is memorialized forever on the side of a building. Or something resembling my name, anyway...

It&#x27;s actually the Epstein-Kosar building in the School of Business Administration at the Univ. of Miami; I found <a href="http://www.miami.edu/UMH/CDA/UMH_Main/1,1770,8548-1;15714-3,00.html">more details in a press release from the 2002 groundbreaking</a>. The donor with something resembling my name is a businessman (no idea whether or not he&#x27;s one of the <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/eppstein.html">namesakes I already knew about</a>), Kosar is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Kosar">the famous quarterback</a>, and the U. Miami president in the news release is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Shalala">Clinton&#x27;s HHS Secretary</a>.
<br />

<br />
It&#x27;s not an especially unusual name, but it makes for an amusing coincidence, anyway.
