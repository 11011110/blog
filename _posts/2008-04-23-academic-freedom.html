Three long but interesting posts showed up today on <a href="http://crookedtimber.org/">Crooked Timber</a> regarding academic freedom.
<br />

<br />
First, <a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2008/04/21/can-anyone-play-this-game/">can anyone play this game?</a> Or, is academic freedom really something different from free speech? Also covering why it might be a bad idea to have a lawyer who specializes in the First Amendment and calls it &quot;a robust marketplace that will marginalize extremism&quot; as Ivy League university president.
<br />

<br />
Second, <a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2008/04/22/academic-freedom-some-propositions/">some propositions</a>. Moving from the east to the west coast, what is the philosophical basis for academic freedom? Is it a self-evident right? Is it a societal contract, in which academics receive quid (freedom) for quo (some other benefit to society that arises from free academics)? Is it just good management on the universities&#x27; part, to keep their employees happy? And what does this all have to do with whether Berkeley should continue to employ war criminal John Yoo?
<br />

<br />
And third, <a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2008/04/22/academic-freedom-some-resources/">some resources</a>. Less in-depth than the other two posts, but a useful list for those who find the blog coverage of this issue too shallow and want some real reading.
