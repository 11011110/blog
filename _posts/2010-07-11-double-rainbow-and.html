<p>It's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQSNhk5ICTI">the latest trend</a>. How can I resist making a small contribution?</p>

<p>Unrelatedly, you know that problem at receptions where holding a plate of hors d'oeuvres in one hand and a wine glass on the other means you don't have a free hand to eat your food with? <a href="http://www.oooms.nl/puzzleboard/">Solved!</a></p>

I'm not sure I've ever felt as much joy as that guy did from seeing a double rainbow.  If one is willing to sacrifice a few points of IQ, I suppose anyone could enjoy a similar (drug-induced) euphoria.
