<p><a href="http://catome.blogspot.com/2005/10/small-world-algorithm-graphs.html">Hans Thomsen shows off some drawings of synthetic small world graphs</a>.  Showing an interesting if unsurprising progression from order to chaos as the beta parameter increases.</p>

<p>He also has <a href="http://catome.blogspot.com/2005/09/ca-1-dimensional-rule-110.html">an earlier post about cellular automata</a>.  Looks like a blog for me to watch more regularly...</p>
