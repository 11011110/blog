After a fuss on social media the top star was able to get an emergency visa; I didn't hear about the rest. Beyond casting doubt on the US-hosted soccer World Cup next year and Olympics in 2028 (noting that climbing is one of the Olympic sports), this can be added to all the existing reasons why now is not a good time to host other international events in the US, such as academic conferences.

* I recently found and corrected a three-year-old mistake in Wikipedia's coverage of polyhedra <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/114552514409836567)):</span> since 2022, several articles including the ones on tetrahedra, convex polyhedra, and orthoschemes (the tetrahedra in which three right-angled edges form a path) have included the claim that every convex polyhedron is scissors-congruent to an orthoscheme (meaning it can be cut into polyhedral pieces that can be reassembled to an orthoscheme).

  It is not true. Scissors congruence is possible only for pairs of polyhedra with equal Dehn invariants. The Dehn invariant, as a tensor <span style="white-space:nowrap">over $$\mathbb{Q}$$,</span> has a rank (like the rank of a matrix, but in an infinite-dimensional space where we haven't specified a basis). The rank is at most equal to the number of edges of a polyhedron, because the Dehn invariant can be written as a sum of rank-one terms, one for each edge. Thus, any orthoscheme has rank at most three (the right-angled edges don't count). But an arbitrary convex polyhedron can have a Dehn invariant with arbitrarily large rank (for instance cut off the corners of a regular prism by general-position planes), and when the rank is four or more it cannot be scissors-congruent to a single orthoscheme. For more on the tensor rank of Dehn invariants see my paper "[Orthogonal dissection into few rectangles](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00454-023-006)" and my posts here "[Dissection into rectangles and tensor rank]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2022-04-03-dissection-into-rectangles %})" and "[Dehn rank revisited]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2022-06-22-dehn-rank-revisited %})".

The artists have used color to highlight different aspects of the tiling.
