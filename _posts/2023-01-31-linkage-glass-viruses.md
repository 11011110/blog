* [FOCS 2023 introduces a new "conjectures track"](https://windowsontheory.org/2023/01/16/new-in-focs-2023-a-conjectures-track/) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/109701298874363291)),</span> seeking papers like the one by Khot that introduced the Unique Games Conjecture.

* [Intersecting ellipses induced by a max-sum matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14200) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/109708982979012608)).</span> Any matching on $$2n$$ plane points is shorter than any star with them as leaves, by the triangle inequality. But sometimes not much shorter: there is a matching and star center from which all matched edges have angles $$\ge 2\pi/3$$, so the length ratio is $$\le 2/\sqrt3$$. This preprint by Barabanshchikova & Polyanskii proves more: the max length matching itself has a star that approximates each edge individually with the same ratio.

* [Three computer scientists have discovered a fast algorithm for finding  shortest paths between points on graphs with negative weights](https://www.quantamagazine.org/finally-a-fast-algorithm-for-shortest-paths-on-negative-graphs-20230118/) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@QuantaMagazine@mstdn.social/109711314801457276)),</span> _Quanta_ summary of a recent breakthrough on a long-standing optimization problem. The original paper by Aaron Bernstein, Danupon Nanongkai, and Christian Wulff-Nilsen is in FOCS 2022 and online at [arXiv:2203.03456](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03456).

* [The release of works into the public domain in Canada goes into a 20-year hiatus](https://blog.archive.org/2023/01/17/as-the-us-public-domain-expands-20-year-pause-for-the-canadian-public-domain-begins/) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/109719958934723525))</span> after its North American partners forced Canada into using Life+70 instead of Life+50 protection terms.

"The bot's misbehavior ranges from verbatim copying to moderate edits to significant rephrasings, all without properly crediting the original. In at least some of its articles, it appears that virtually every sentence maps directly onto something previously published elsewhere."

* [Nice explainer on the continuum hypothesis](https://mathstodon.xyz/@kameryn/109756698881498419) and how the idea that its independence makes the problem intractable "misses the actual nuance of the mathematical terrain": for any "natural"-enough set, the dichotomy between the cardinalities of $$\mathbb{N}$$ and $$\mathbb{R}$$ is valid and provable.

* I have no mathematical point to share here <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/109765566564556642)),</span> just a recoloring of an old image I made of the [Folkman graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folkman_graph) that I thought came out interesting-looking. It is something like one of Escher's impossible figures: Locally it looks like it could be made from overlapping translucent sheets of blue material, cut out in this pattern, but globally it doesn't all fit together.

There are 20 points where the arcs cross a central circle; if these points are are taken as the vertices of a graph, and the arcs between them taken as edges of a graph, the result is the Folkman graph, the smallest graph that is symmetric on its edges but not on its vertices.]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/2023/Folkman-shaded.svg){: style="width:100%;max-width:600px" }

* You've probably heard about the glass flowers at Harvard, but have you seen [Luke Jerram's glass viruses and bacteria](https://www.lukejerram.com/glass/) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/109771266602473224),</span> [via](https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2023/01/luke-jerram-glass-microbes/))?
