Needed to find a 30-year-old paper at the library yesterday, from a reference to &quot;C.R. Acad. Sci. Paris&quot;.  Fortunately, I remembered what C.R. stood for, but couldn&#x27;t remember offhand whether the next words would be du or de l&#x27;... eventually I just entered &quot;Comptes Rendus&quot; in the catalog, and scanned through the seven pages of results to find one that looked right, Comptes Rendus de l&#x27;Académie des Sciences.  Or rather, many that looked right, because that name belonged to many different series, none of which seemed to match the one in the citation I was searching for.  I almost decided that this meant our library didn&#x27;t have what I wanted and started to prepare an interlibrary loan request, until I realized that the closest matching entry had a pointer to a previous C.R. series that it continued under a different name.  Half a dozen name-change backpointers later, I finally found Comptes Rendus Hebdomadaires des Séances de l&#x27;Académie des Sciences, with the correct series, from which I found the call numbers to locate it in the stacks.  Where all the C.R.s were shelved together, under the same call number, so I again had to scan sequentially through them to locate the correct series again.
<br />

<br />
From which I conclude that there&#x27;s a lot to be said for on-line full-text journal archives, and services like ACM Portal and Google Scholar that index them, despite their impermanence compared to paper.
<br />

<br />
Also that precision and usability are to some extent conflicting goals in bibliography.  I mean, who cares whether the word &quot;Hebdomadaires&quot; was in the journal name for some years and not for other years, just let me know where I can find my papers.
