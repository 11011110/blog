In the absence of a good textbook for my graduate data structures class, I&#x27;ve put together another collection of Wikipedia articles as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book:Fundamental_Data_Structures">Book:Fundamental Data Structures</a>. A lot of what I cover in my course is in there, along with a few other topics that I haven&#x27;t covered. There was also already <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book:Data_structures">a different collection on a similar topic</a>, but I tried to make this one a bit more focused only on the most basic and important abstract data types â€” some of the things I cover later in the course such as persistence, geometric range searching or lowest common ancestors are omitted.

This looks like an excellent collection.

Teaching undergrad data structures for the last two years has got me working on a similar project (http://opendatastructures.org/), though mine more closely resembles a traditional textbook.

I&#x27;ve also found a couple of other ones:
