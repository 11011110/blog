<p>I didn't spend a lot of time on photography in Halifax, and only ended up with one picture worth keeping:</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/halifax/Halifax-m.jpg" alt="Ship at harbor in Halifax, Nova Scotia" style="border-style:solid;border-color:black;" /></p>

<p>I somehow avoided the clich√© shots of the lovely little green hilly island across the harbor with the lovely little white lighthouse on it that the English used as a lovely little concentration camp for the forcibly removed local French population in the mid-18th century.</p>

<p>And what about the lovely little pirate boat?</p>

<p>I don't think I even shot any photos of it to discard later.</p>

<p>The repeated "lovely", by the way, is in part a reference to our tour guide in Slovenia, who used that word to describe everything we saw. But I shouldn't be too mean, because her English was far far better than my Slovenian...</p>
