I didn&#x27;t spend a lot of time on photography in Halifax, and only ended up with one picture worth keeping:
<br />

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/halifax/Halifax-m.jpg" style="border-style:solid;border-color:black;" /></div>
<br />

<br />
I somehow avoided the clich√© shots of the lovely little green hilly island across the harbor with the lovely little white lighthouse on it that the English used as a lovely little concentration camp for the forcibly removed local French population in the mid-18th century.

And what about the lovely little pirate boat?

I don&#x27;t think I even shot any photos of it to discard later.

The repeated &quot;lovely&quot;, by the way, is in part a reference to our tour guide in Slovenia, who used that word to describe everything we saw. But I shouldn&#x27;t be too mean, because her English was far far better than my Slovenian...
