It&#x27;s Friday, and it&#x27;s two weeks after the last Carnival of Mathematics, so it must be carnival time again! <a href="http://blog.mikael.johanssons.org/archive/2007/03/carnival-of-mathematics-3/">Michi hosts the third carnival of mathematics</a>.

Just a small note: my webserver dove the last weekend. I hope to get it back up again tonight, but the only person with physical access to the box is currently traveling back from Germany.
