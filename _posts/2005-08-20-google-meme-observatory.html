When you want to find out where some new catchphrase like &quot;my hed iz pastede on yay&quot; comes from, <a href="http://urchin.earth.li/cgi-bin/twic/wiki/view.pl?page=GoogleMemeObservatory">Google meme observatory</a> looks like the place to go.  Don&#x27;t know how I avoided running into that site before.  I&#x27;ve certainly wondered about some of these phrases but by the time they attain enough popularity to make me notice and wonder, they&#x27;re also widespread enough that a simple Google search doesn&#x27;t necessarily return much of use.  So it&#x27;s good that someone else has gone to the effort of tracking them down.
