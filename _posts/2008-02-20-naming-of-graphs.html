<a href="http://sbseminar.wordpress.com/2008/02/19/mathematical-grammar/">There&#x27;s an interesting discussion going on at the Secret Blogging Seminar</a> about graph-theoretic terminology. It started out being about what to call a directed graph that is not acyclic, and somehow segued from there into whether the empty graph is connected.

I believe it&#x27;s a continuation of an discussion from Tea at Berkeley, where a lot of mathematicians have the sort of conversation one would assume mathematicians have when stoned (though I promise most of us are on nothing stronger than tea and cookies at the time).

I assume it must happen often enough, but I don&#x27;t recall ever seeing a stoned mathematician.

Hang around the town of Berkeley long enough, and you&#x27;ll see someone from just about any walk of life you can think of stoned eventually.

There used to be (and maybe still is) a regular and well-attended &quot;Green Seminar&quot; at Berkeley, held on the Evans 10th-floor balcony.  Or so I&#x27;m told.
