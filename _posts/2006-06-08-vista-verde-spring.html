Sara&#x27;s school choir had another vocal music concert last night: lots of preteen girls (and the occasional boy) singing folk, Disney and Broadway tunes. Pretty well, actually, without the painful flatness that we&#x27;ve sometimes had in past concerts, and some of the pieces were very entertaining or moving. Sara had a solo part this time, which she did well, I think. <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/vvsc06/index.html">Photos here</a>.
