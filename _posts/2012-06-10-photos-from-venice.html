So here are <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/venice/index.html">my photos of Venice</a>, from my trip to FUN (or more specifically from a stormy Monday evening and glorious sunset on San Servolo and then from the Tuesday afternoon group walk through the not-quite-so-touristy parts of town, with resident Venetian Marco Squarcina as guide).
