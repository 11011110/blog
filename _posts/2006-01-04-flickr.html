Mike G. persuaded me to get a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/11011110/">flickr account</a>. So now you can look at a small fraction of my photos, selected for their non-snapshotness, and comment on them or do whatever other things flickr might let its users do with photos.  <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/11011110/23994.html">Maybe even play Sudoku with them</a>.  I&#x27;m not really expecting it to be any better at leading to useful feedback on the photos than <a href="http://www.photo.net/photodb/member-photos?include=all&user_id=446555">photo.net</a> wasn&#x27;t, but maybe at least a few more people will find them that way.
