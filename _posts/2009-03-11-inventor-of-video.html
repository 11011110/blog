<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_T._Goldsmith,_Jr.">Thomas T. Goldsmith, Jr.</a> was an important pioneer in the early television industry (TV station WTTG is named after him). In 1948, he invented the first video game, in some sense a predecessor of modern first-person shooters (it involved a simulation of WWII missile targeting systems) and nearly simultaneously invented the video game patent. As I recently learned, he died on March 5, at age 99. For more, see his Wikipedia article.
