<p>The hotel I stayed at during WADS, the Windermere Manor in London, Ontario, keeps a set of beehives on their grounds. They serve the honey at breakfast, and use it to brew their "honey-stung ale" (a nice nut-brown beer that I had with dinner one of the nights there). These are their hotel suites:</p>
