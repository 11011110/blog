* The following lemma on distances between two out of three points around an obstacle is part of [my new preprint on integer distances]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2024-01-14-integer-distances-floppy %}). I'm curious, has anyone seen it before?

  **Lemma**: _Suppose that three given points in $$\mathbb{R}^d$$ are disjoint from an open convex set $$U$$. Then two of the points can be connected by a curve disjoint from $$U$$ of length at most twice their Euclidean distance._ <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/111684852268964512)).</span>

  For instance, in the plane, two nearby points can be separated by a thickened line or line segment, so they have no short connecting curve, but three points cannot all be made far from each other by a single convex obstacle. See the preprint for the (not very difficult) proof, whose illustration is below.

The particles move toward their friend, away from their enemy, and toward the center of the screen. The resulting system shoots off arcs of particles that then slowly return to the center, "nicely chaotic behavior with no real physics". Constructed and animated by Craig S. Kaplan.

  * [Small set expansion hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_set_expansion_hypothesis): A graph is a small set expander if every small-enough set of vertices has many edges out of it. In the simplified definition used by this article (following Barak), "small-enough" means at most  and "many" means close to the degree of the vertices in the graph. The question is: suppose I give you a regular graph, and I promise you that either it is a small set expander, or it is very far from being a small set expander (there is a small set of vertices with very few edges out of it). Can you tell which? The small set expansion hypothesis is that this question should be $$\mathsf{NP}$$-hard. It's closely related to the more famous unique games conjecture (it implies unique games and has been suggested to be equivalent), and like unique games provides a way of collecting together many conjectured inapproximability results.

* I found myself shut out of Google Scholar (again) because I did a big but entirely manual search on JSTOR <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/111750867276928897)),</span> collecting roughly 52 book review citations for a new Wikipedia article on Renaissance historian [Margaret L. King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_L._King). Although this did not cause JSTOR itself to show any annoyance, its back-and-forth with Google on each search step triggered Google's "unusual robot activity" flags. Fortunately it only blocked one browser for a day, so I was able to make do with a backup browser, but it's a very irritating aspect of JSTOR that normal use can have such consequences well beyond the site.
