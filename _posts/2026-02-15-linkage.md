* [Morphing between a polyhedron and its dual using 3d-printed scissor-link edges](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mechmachtheory.2025.106187) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@henryseg/115952247331406045))</span> raises the question of which polyhedra can be realized in this way. The linked paper by Liao, Kiper, and Krishnan suggests that they need to be midscribed and have equal-length edges to avoid binding during the morph. A much weaker but obvious necessary condition is that for each pair of dual edges the lengths are equal. But it is unclear which polyhedra have realizations with this property.

Discontinuity is necessary to avoid this. This is from 2023 so I suspect the specific buggy behavior is long fixed but the phenomenon will recur for any attempt like this one to define a formula using only continuous building blocks.

  Real monotone functions are inverse when their graphs are mirror reflections across the diagonal <span style="white-space:nowrap">line $$y=x$$.</span> We can define something like a graph for an integer function, a staircase curve whose lowest point above any integer on the <span style="white-space:nowrap">$$x$$-axis</span> gives the function value; then two integer functions are almost-inverse when these curves are mirror reflections. The image below shows these two reflected staircase curves for the prime-counting function and its almost-inverse. This pair of functions corresponds to the partition of positive integers into prime and non-prime (composite or one).

  By using this equivalence to go from functions to partitions and back, you can sometimes get amazing formulas for sequences of integers that you might not expect to have a formula at all. For instance, the <span style="white-space:nowrap">$$n$$th number</span> that is not a <span style="white-space:nowrap">$$k$$th power</span> (for <span style="white-space:nowrap">integer $$k>1$$)</span> has the formula:

  $$n+\left\lfloor\sqrt[k]{n + \lfloor\sqrt[k]{n}\rfloor}\right\rfloor.$$

  Now a Good Article on Wikipedia.

* I have been experimenting with [ltx-talk](https://ctan.org/pkg/ltx-talk?lang=en) as a replacement for beamer as a way to use LaTeX to make lecture slides <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/116060876141129606)),</span> in preparation for the [April 24 doomsday](https://link.ucop.edu/2025/03/04/new-regulations-for-the-americans-with-disabilities-act-that-will-impact-uc/) in which all online content of all US universities is required to meet WCAG 2.1 A/AA accessibility standards (including properly tagged pdf).  [My test slide deck](https://www.overleaf.com/read/nyfdjxbqmbqc#309a25) is based on [beamer slides on union-find and its analysis](https://ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/261/lecture10b.pdf) from my graduate data structures course.  It sort of works but is still obviously a work in progress.

  Minor issues:

  - This requires lualatex 2025-11-01 or more recent. I can run this in Overleaf Labs but cannot find a recent-enough MacTeX.

  - The LaTeX preamble is different and the formatting changes it makes were largely undocumented.

  - I needed a hack to make natbib work. Actually two hacks but one was already there for beamer.

  - I had to change `\begin{frame}{Title}` to `\begin{frame}\frametitle{Title}` everywhere.

  - I had to change `\column{size}` to `\begin{column}{size} ... \end{column}` everywhere.

  - The tabular environment needs to be tagged for whether it is really a table (and which of its rows are headers) or just for formatting; see [the LaTeX tagging project's accessible formatting tips](https://latex3.github.io/tagging-project/documentation/usage-instructions).

  Major issues:

  - Compiling `$\approx 2\times 10^{19728}$` ($$\approx 2\times 10^{19728}$$) caused lualatex to get into an apparent infinite loop and time out. Is it trying to calculate $$10^{19728}$$??

  - Some expressions with `$\dots$` produce empty output. This would be a minor issue but having this empty output in the cells of a tabular environment caused lualatex to crash with the code "`error: (nodes): fuzzy token cleanup in whatsit node with type whatsit and subtype 29`". Using `$\ldots$` or `$\cdots$` as appropriate worked.

  - beamer has an option `\begin{frame}[allowframebreaks]` that paginates overlong frames, necessary for bibtex bibliographies. It does not work in ltx-talk and I cannot find a replacement for this functionality. The test deck uses a tiny font for the bibliography but this is not very satisfactory and will not scale to larger bibliographies.
