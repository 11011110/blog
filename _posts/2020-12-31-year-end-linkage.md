* [A mathematician’s unanticipated journey through the physical world](https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-mathematicians-adventure-through-the-physical-world-20201216/) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/105394664282719115)). _Quanta_ profiles [Lauren Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauren_Williams) and discusses her work on enumerating cells of Grassmannians and its unexpected connections with intersection patterns of solitons.

* [Connecticut state university system faculty contract negotiations go sour](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/12/15/draconian-contract-proposals-connecticut) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/105402517620055997)). Proposals include increasing units taught per term, adding a term, halving units counted per hour of teaching, doubling required office hours, killing a cap on part-timers, adding required weekend teaching, eliminating faculty ownership of course content, eliminating funds for faculty travel and research, eliminating committee review of personnel actions, and monitoring emails for union activity.

* [Pat Morin implements the product structure for planar graphs in Python](https://github.com/patmorin/lhp) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@patmorin/105396573803578266)). This is part of a recent line of research in which planar graphs can be decomposed as subgraphs of strong products of paths with bounded-treewidth graphs. Pat writes: "Not exactly industrial-strength, and leans towards simplicity over performance.  Still, it can  decompose 100k-vertex triangulations in a few seconds."

* [Modular origami polyhedra systems](http://make-origami.com/RonaGurkewitz/home.php) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/105408938256987767)). An old link by [Rona Gurkewitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rona_Gurkewitz) from my Geometry Junkyard, moved to a new address.

* [Socrates as anti-democratic enabler of tyrannical coups](https://diagonalargument.com/2020/12/08/socrates-bad-guy/) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/105419425427517260)). None of this analysis is particularly new, but it's not the version of Socrates you'll see when you look at [the Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates).

* [Blichfeldt's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blichfeldt%27s_theorem) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/105422739565106313)): Any set in the plane of area greater than one can be translated to contain two integer points. New article on Wikipedia, connected to an expansion of the [biography  of Hans Blichfeldt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Frederick_Blichfeldt), who came to the US from Denmark as a teenager in 1888 and worked for several years as a lumberman, railway worker, and surveyor before his mathematical talent was recognized and he became one of the first students at Stanford.

* I've been experimenting with [git-svn](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-svn) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/105426263611221446)), for a new project whose coauthors chose svn. It somehow manages to be clunkier than either svn or git by themselves. I understand why svn's linear history forces compromise, but mostly I tend to keep a linear history anyway. I just want git pull and push to work, but instead I have to learn new un-mnemonic commands (for which [the cheatsheet of equivalences from svn to git-svn](https://git.wiki.kernel.org/images-git/7/78/Git-svn-cheatsheet.pdf) was helpful). The only advantage over svn that I found was you have a local copy of the history, although in the comments David Bremner suggests more.

* ["Why I never ‘agree to disagree’ — I just tell you when you’re wrong"](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-12-22/agree-to-disagree) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/105431453312440767)). _Los Angeles Times_ columnist Michael Hiltzik on truth versus neutrality, and why it is incorrect and intellectually lazy for public media to treat certain firmly-established facts — such as the existence of the COVID pandemic, the outcome of the recent US election, or human-driven climate change — as topics on which debate is still reasonable. 

* [The perfect Christmas cookie cutter: one that tessellates your cookie dough sheet with Christmas trees](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/best-christmas-cookie-cutter) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/105436497912189975)).

* [Using gradient descent to find Christmas-tree-shaped fractals](https://hardmath123.github.io/chaos-game-fractal-foliage.html) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/105439870724073086)).

* [Lars Arge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lars_Arge) died of cancer on December 23 ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/105447919719671152)). You can read an [obituary by his department chair](https://cs.au.dk/news-events/news/show-news/artikel/in-memoriam-professor-lars-arge/) and [another by Suresh Venkatasubramanian](http://blog.geomblog.org/2020/12/lars-arge.html). Lars was a leading researcher in algorithms for massive data, and an anchor for algorithms and computational geometry in Denmark. As Suresh writes, he was a larger-than-life figure; we'll miss him.

* [Reinhardt polygons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinhardt_polygon) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/105454229077474608)). These polygons have equal side lengths and are inscribed in Reuleaux polygons. Among all convex polygons with the same number of sides (any number that is not a power of two), they have the largest possible perimeter for their diameter, the largest possible width for their diameter, and the largest possible width for their perimeter. New Wikipedia article.

* [Moshe Vardi suggests taking advantage of this year's disruption to the dysfunctional computer science conference publication system by setting up a replacement that is more scalable and doesn't involve large amounts of carbon-expensive travel](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2021/1/249441-reboot-the-computing-research-publication-systems/fulltext) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/105460878037520050)). He doesn't really say what this new system (or old journal system?) should be, though, only that we should design it.

* [What winter looks like in different parts of the world](https://mathstodon.xyz/@christianp/105465163493715434). Long photo-thread responding to a request by Christian Lawson-Perfect's 3-year-old. Here's [my contribution](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/105466532506211765), with prickly pairs and the distant snow-topped San Gabriel mountains in Southern California:

* [Game of Life running on Penrose tiles](https://boingboing.net/2020/12/29/game-of-life-running-on-penrose-tiles.html) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/105473798576179397)). With links to a _New York Times_ feature of "[short reflections from big thinkers on why Conway's famous cellular-automata gewgaw remains so fascinating](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/28/science/math-conway-game-of-life.html)". From which I found Kjetil Golid's generative-art [crosshatch automata](https://generated.space/sketch/crosshatch-automata/).

* Two analyses of citation vs other impact in mathematics ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/105477934629467245)):

  - In "[Don't count on it](https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/202101/rnoti-p114.pdf)" in the _Notices_, Edward Dunne compares highly cited mathematicians to winners of multiple prizes; high citations clustered in few topics, while prize winners were widely distributed across research areas.

  - In "[Citations versus expert opinions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05389)" (arXiv:2005.05389, [via retractionwatch](https://retractionwatch.com/2020/12/19/weekend-reads-prof-sues-journal-school-after-demotion-following-retraction-researcher-fired-after-questioning-why-school-rejected-grant-the-authors-who-like-publish-or-perish/)), Smolinsky et al compare highly cited papers to MathSciNet featured reviews, again finding little overlap.
