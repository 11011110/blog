<p>Congratulations to John Augustine, who passed his thesis defense today and is joining Colby College in Maine. John's thesis, under the supervision of Sandy Irani, combines work on online power management algorithms and on strip packing for multiprocessor scheduling and related problems. He's also done some work with me on adding weights to core-sets for approximating geometric optimization. John came to UCI from Louisiana State, where he was a masters student of the late Steve Seiden, also Sandy's Ph.D. supervisee, so in some sense he's his own nephew and his own uncle.</p>

<p>Together with <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/2006/07/18/congratulations-dr-sun.html">Jonathan Sun</a> and Jeremy Meng (who passed his defense earlier this year on the subject of confluent graph drawing algorithms and is joining Microsoft) this makes three Ph.D. graduates from theory in ICS this year, a good level of productivity for us.</p>
