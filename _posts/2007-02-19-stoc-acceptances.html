By now I&#x27;ve seen <a href="http://geomblog.blogspot.com/2007/02/stoc-2007-results-out.html">two</a> <a href="http://valis.cs.uiuc.edu/blog/?p=467">posts</a> telling me that <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/research/theory/feige/homepagefiles/stoc2007accept.txt">the STOC acceptances are out</a>. It&#x27;s rare that I go to STOC, because if I&#x27;m going to one conference at that time of year I&#x27;ll pick SoCG every time, but there are some interesting looking titles there. Here are some titles that make me want to find out more:
<br />

<br />
Leslie Ann Goldberg and Mark Jerrum
<br />
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.CC/0605140">Inapproximability of the Tutte polynomial</a>
<br />

<br />
Elchanan Mossel and Sebastien Roch
<br />
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/math.PR/0612046">On the Submodularity of Influence in Social Networks</a>
<br />

<br />
Ittai Abraham, Yair Bartal and Ofer Neiman
<br />
Local Embeddings of Metric Spaces
<br />
(Google can&#x27;t find the preprint, but <a href="http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~neiman/local-abstract">a talk abstract is online</a>).
