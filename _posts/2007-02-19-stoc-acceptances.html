<p>By now I've seen <a href="http://geomblog.blogspot.com/2007/02/stoc-2007-results-out.html">two</a> <a href="http://valis.cs.uiuc.edu/blog/?p=467">posts</a> telling me that <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/research/theory/feige/homepagefiles/stoc2007accept.txt">the STOC acceptances are out</a>. It's rare that I go to STOC, because if I'm going to one conference at that time of year I'll pick SoCG every time, but there are some interesting looking titles there. Here are some titles that make me want to find out more:</p>

<p>Leslie Ann Goldberg and Mark Jerrum<br />
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.CC/0605140">Inapproximability of the Tutte polynomial</a></p>

<p>Elchanan Mossel and Sebastien Roch<br />
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/math.PR/0612046">On the Submodularity of Influence in Social Networks</a></p>

<p>Ittai Abraham, Yair Bartal and Ofer Neiman<br />
Local Embeddings of Metric Spaces<br />
(Google can't find the preprint, but <a href="http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~neiman/local-abstract">a talk abstract is online</a>).</p>
