Old and busted: fake conferences that <a href="http://twitter.com/jefferickson/status/5770460813">scam money out of academics using high registration fees</a>, <a href="http://11011110.livejournal.com/159002.html">accept everything rather than subjecting submissions to any sort of peer review</a>, but actually exist: you can attend them, meet the other dupes, and get a proceedings.
<br />

<br />
The new hot trend: <a href="http://www.the-scientist.com/blog/display/56185/">fake conferences that don&#x27;t exist</a>, come with (nonexistent) paid travel expenses to invited speakers and, presumably, scam money out of academics by getting them to send their banking data to the organizers.

The few academic conferences that I&#x27;ve been to, I&#x27;m wondering about the papers that were NOT accepted...

True, it&#x27;s not difficult to find legitimate conferences with low standards.
