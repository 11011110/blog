<p>These four papers have all been published in journals within the past few months; I just now updated my online pub list and the arxiv metadata for them to match.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.comgeo.2006.05.007">Minimum dilation stars</a> (in CGTA, with Kevin Wortman)</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00453-006-0159-8">Confluent layered drawing</a> (in Algorithmica, with Mike Goodrich and Jeremy Meng)</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1240233.1240239">Deterministic sampling and range counting in geometric data streams</a> (in ACM Trans. Alg., with Bagchi, Chaudhary, and Goodrich)</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://jgaa.info/accepted/2007/Eppstein2007.11.1.pdf">The traveling salesman problem for cubic graphs</a> (in JGAA)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>To keep this from being totally content-free, here's an unsolved graph theory problem from the last paper (I thought I'd posted this before, but now I can't find it, so...):</p>

<p>In that paper, there are matching \(2^{n/2}\) upper and lower bounds on the number of Hamiltonian cycles in 3-regular multigraphs (the lower bound is formed by a cycle that alternates between single and double bonds). But for simple cubic graphs, the best bounds I have are a \(2^{3n/8}\) upper bound, and a \(2^{n/3}\) lower bound. I conjecture that the \(2^{n/3}\) lower bound is tight. Can a matching upper bound be proven?</p>
