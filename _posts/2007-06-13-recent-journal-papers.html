These four papers have all been published in journals within the past few months; I just now updated my online pub list and the arxiv metadata for them to match.
<br />

<br />

<br />
To keep this from being totally content-free, here&#x27;s an unsolved graph theory problem from the last paper (I thought I&#x27;d posted this before, but now I can&#x27;t find it, so...):
<br />

<br />
In that paper, there are matching 2<sup>n/2</sup> upper and lower bounds on the number of Hamiltonian cycles in 3-regular multigraphs (the lower bound is formed by a cycle that alternates between single and double bonds). But for simple cubic graphs, the best bounds I have are a 2<sup>3n/8</sup> upper bound, and a 2<sup>n/3</sup> lower bound. I conjecture that the 2<sup>n/3</sup> lower bound is tight. Can a matching upper bound be proven?
