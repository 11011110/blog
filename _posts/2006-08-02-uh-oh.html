<a href="http://autos.msn.com/advice/article.aspx?contentid=2891">Six of last year&#x27;s ten most frequently stolen car models are Acura Integras</a>. My 1990 model doesn&#x27;t make the list, but probably only because there are fewer of them on the road than the more recent ones.

Better to leave hte doors unlocked, I think. If someone wants to steal your car, they&#x27;ll just break the window.  Its not look people go looking for an unlocked car... that&#x27;d be too time-consuming I think.

And which would you rather have, a stolen car returned, or a stolen car returned with a smashed window?

A locked door keeps an honest person honest.  Certainly it won&#x27;t stop a thief, but at least if the thief needs to break the glass, it should be fairly obvious to any casual observer that something is amiss.

There&#x27;s also the related issue that if you don&#x27;t lock your doors, and your car gets stolen, then you haven&#x27;t done everything in your power to prevent the theft of your car, and your insurance company can be unpleasant about any possible payouts (regardless of its return).
