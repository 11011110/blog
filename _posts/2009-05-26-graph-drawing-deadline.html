A reminder: the <a href="http://facweb.cs.depaul.edu/gd2009/gd2009.asp">Graph Drawing Symposium</a> submission deadline is approaching. Get your graph drawing submissions ready!
<br />

<br />
We recently changed the submission deadline, from May 31 to June 3, to articulate better with some other conference deadlines. Unlike <a href="http://11011110.livejournal.com/140718.html">previous years&#x27; extensions</a> we&#x27;ve tried to make this change sufficiently early that it will also be useful for providing extra time to write new submissions.
