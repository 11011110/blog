<p>A reminder: the <a href="http://facweb.cs.depaul.edu/gd2009/gd2009.asp">Graph Drawing Symposium</a> submission deadline is approaching. Get your graph drawing submissions ready!</p>

<p>We recently changed the submission deadline, from May 31 to June 3, to articulate better with some other conference deadlines. Unlike <a href="{{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2008-05-29-extended-deadline-for %}">previous years' extensions</a> we've tried to make this change sufficiently early that it will also be useful for providing extra time to write new submissions.</p>
