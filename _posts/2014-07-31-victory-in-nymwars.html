<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nymwars">nymwars</a> are the struggle to maintain online safe havens for pseudonymous free speech, for people who don't feel safe linking their opinions with their real names (for fear of religious persecution / sexual predation / current or future job prospects / whatever else) in the face of attempts by Facebook, Google, and others to force everyone to cross-link all their personal information. Soon after its launch in 2011, Google+ took a strong stand that only people willing to post under their real names would be welcome on the site, and (as one very minor consequence) I stopped posting there. Now, finally, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190317184621/https://plus.google.com/101560853443212199687/posts/V5XkYQYYJqy">Google+ has relented</a> and will allow arbitrary user-chosen identities. They <a href="http://infotrope.net/2014/07/16/meanwhile-in-an-alternate-universe/">could have been more apologetic about it</a>, but it's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190317185218/https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/DGS9E3eJBGb">enough for me to return there</a>.</p>

<p>I don't intend to change my Livejournal posting habits much, as I've been using my Google+ account for a somewhat different purpose: posting brief links to web sites that catch my attention and that I think might be of interest to my (mostly technical/academic) circles of contacts there. Here's a roundup of a dozen or so links I've posted so far (skipping the ones where I linked back to my LJ postings).</p>
