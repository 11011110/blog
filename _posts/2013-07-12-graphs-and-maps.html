<p>The art exhibit from the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2013-04-08-brief-history-of %}">Dagstuhl workshop I reported on last April</a> is now online. It's called "<a href="http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/about-dagstuhl/kunst/bending-reality/">Bending Reality: Where arc and science meet</a>", and it has lots of interesting visualizations and diagrams, grouped into several categories. My own ones are listed under "mathematical abstractions".</p>
