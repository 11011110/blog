The art exhibit from the <a href="http://11011110.livejournal.com/267146.html">Dagstuhl workshop I reported on last April</a> is now online. It&#x27;s called &quot;<a href="http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/about-dagstuhl/kunst/bending-reality/">Bending Reality: Where arc and science meet</a>&quot;, and it has lots of interesting visualizations and diagrams, grouped into several categories. My own ones are listed under &quot;mathematical abstractions&quot;.
