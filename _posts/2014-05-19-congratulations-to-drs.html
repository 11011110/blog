It must be that time of year...Friday and today I took part in two more thesis defenses, for Brian Parrish and Paweł Pszona.
<br />

<br />
Brian is a mechanical engineering student, supervised by fellow Wikipedia editor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Prof_McCarthy">Mike McCarthy</a>. His thesis research was to develop a system that can automatically analyze the configuration space of an eight-bar linkage and determine whether it can smoothly move between a desired set of poses. Somehow I got involved because setting up a system of equations describing the motion of these linkages involves some interesting graph algorithm problems. He&#x27;s been working at Northrop Grumman, who supported him through his doctorate, and I imagine will continue working for them afterward.
<br />

Paweł is a theoretical computer scientist, supervised by Mike Goodrich. The topics he included in his thesis were external-memory approximation of graph <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneracy_(graph_theory)">degeneracy</a>, applications of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order-maintenance_problem">list labeling</a> in the visualization of dynamic graphs, and three-dimensional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_diagram">arc diagrams</a>. For the third of these topics, he brought along some props, 3d prints of his graph visualizations, which I think make the graph structure much clearer than their 2d projections. He has also done some interesting work with Goodrich (not part of his thesis) on <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.3000">making parametric search practical</a>, and very recently published another paper with me and others on <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.0286">cuckoo hashing on storage devices with limited rewrite capacity</a>. After he finishes he will be joining navigation-system company <a href="http://www.tomtom.com">TomTom</a> in Berlin.

Congratulations, both of you!
