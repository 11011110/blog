* Elsevier made up a fake reference for the boilerplate they use to show authors how to format their references, some authors forgot to delete it, and [now it has a lot of citations](http://retractionwatch.com/2017/11/14/phantom-reference-made-article-got-almost-400-citations/) ([G+](https://web.archive.org/web/20190216204330/https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/6bcrJ7oN58Q)). Ho hum. But through this I learned that there is a [_Lorem Ipsum Journal_](http://taller.infoacceso.org/index.php/rev/article/view/16) with a paper whose abstract is the text of the [lorem ipsum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum).

* [Olivetti Elettrosumma 22](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/5209). The [Elettrosumma 22](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivetti_Elettrosumma_22) was an old electromechanical calculator, and this artwork by Giovanni Pintori from when it was new was apparently intended as a typographic exploration of its digit forms. But to me it looks like a village on a hillside, with shapes reminiscent of [my work on orthogonal polyhedra](http://doi.org/10.20382/jocg.v5i1a10).

* [Triangulating the locations of so-far-undiscovered ancient cities by using trade volume as a proxy for distance](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/11/13/ancient-data-modern-math-and-the-hunt-for-11-lost-cities-of-the-bronze-age/) ([G+](https://web.archive.org/web/20190216204231/https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/LKqcvFjq2TM), [via](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15729616)).

* [Antignocchi](https://www.piquenewsmagazine.com/whistler/the-best-of-foods-best/Content?oid=12668045) and six other spatial patterns ([G+](https://web.archive.org/web/20190216204124/https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/dzcvt7qUusM)). In the comments, Jeff E. notes that it should actually be cognocchi.

* [What can we learn from the accretion of errors in copied ancient mathematical diagrams?](http://www.pnas.org/content/114/47/12353.full) ([G+](https://web.archive.org/web/20190216203832/https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/1rQBTYDSr7q)), by Stephen Ormes in _PNAS_.

* [Computer models of housing segregation](https://www.americanscientist.org/article/the-math-of-segregation) ([G+](https://web.archive.org/web/20190216203727/https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/iVqm9exjncN), [via](https://web.archive.org/web/20190216203758/https://plus.google.com/105473622219622697310/posts/dQddT5n3QVp)). Very weak levels of [homophily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophily) lead to big clear segregated regions. But paradoxically, high levels freeze the initial desegregated situation into place.

* [Jeff Barrett and Frank Artzenius's infinite decision puzzle](http://www.socsci.uci.edu/~jabarret/bio/publications/InfiniteDecisionPuzzle.pdf) ([G+](https://web.archive.org/web/20190216203429/https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/SEgfURbUuG9), [more G+ comments](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/gplus/20171124-SEgfURbUuG9.html)), in which taking more money in each step can leave you with less at the end.

* [Being a woman in math and academia](http://www.math-chocolate-circus.com/being-a-woman-in-math-and-academia/). Stories of parental pressure, awkward comments and inappropriate advances, and a successful targeted-for-affirmative-action hire.

* [Radon plays the urn](http://sarielhp.org/blog/?p=9357), a problem on selecting and replacing random colored balls from an urn motivated by an old paper of mine on [quickly and robustly estimating high-dimensional central tendencies](http://kenclarkson.org/center/p.pdf).

* How to blow your academic credibility in three easy steps ([G+](https://web.archive.org/web/20190216203242/https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/XbQJ7L1Mchc)):
 1. Write a [_PNAS_ paper](http://www.pnas.org/content/112/49/15060.full) claiming renewable power sources are enough for all our energy needs.
 2. Read your critics' countering [_PNAS_ paper](http://www.pnas.org/content/114/26/6722.full) claiming that those sources are not enough and we need nuclear power (everyone still agreeing that fossil fuels are right out; they're scientists, not Republicans)
 3. [Sue them!](http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-jacobson-lawsuit-20171121-story.html) 

  Someone complained that the _LA Times_ link didn't work, so [here's another story on the same situation](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/11/01/stanford-professor-files-libel-suit-against-leading-scientific-journal-over-clean-energy-claims/).

* Are you an academic from another country who gives invited talks as part of your academic practice? Then don't take a position in Denmark or the immigration authorities there will [charge you as a criminal for taking side jobs](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/11/28/american-professor-denmark-says-shes-being-targeted-immigration-officials-delivering) ([G+](https://web.archive.org/web/20190216202846/https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/atsRwczBi3Y), [more G+ comments](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/gplus/20171128-atsRwczBi3Y.html)). According to English-language but local sources [this is only one of 14 similar ongoing cases](http://cphpost.dk/news/foreign-professors-being-reported-to-police-for-passing-on-knowledge.html).

* The headline says "[soft robots acquire origami skeletons for super-strength](https://www.wired.com/story/soft-robots-origami-skeletons/)" but really these carefully shaped inflatable bladders act more like muscles.

* [Quasiconvex tilings from lattices](https://web.archive.org/web/20190216202550/https://plus.google.com/113086553300459368002/posts/aMm17RELcsJ). Greg Egan describes how to extend the integer-lattice-slicing method for generating quasiperiodic tilings to other lattices, using Voronoiâ€“Delaunay duality. This one is two-dimensional; he also has new posts on [one-dimensional](https://web.archive.org/web/20190216202731/https://plus.google.com/113086553300459368002/posts/VJBnyhxH44y) and [three-dimensional](https://web.archive.org/web/20190216202758/https://plus.google.com/113086553300459368002/posts/96ynVvdGCyv) quasiperiodic patterns generated in similar ways.
