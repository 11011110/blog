<p>Ok, <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/banff/index.html">my Banff pictures are up</a>. Here's a small sample:</p>

<p>More coming later after I sort through the ones Diana took while I was (mostly) <a href="{{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2009-08-24-report-from-wads %}">going to talks</a>.</p>

Oh, it's GORGEOUS in summer. My Banff photos are all white.

This was my first time there, so I can't really compare, but yes, it was very pretty. I regret a little bit not having time to continue further on the hike behind Lake Louise; I've heard that it's even more spectacular in there.

Yes, there's the plain of the six glaciers (somewhat depleted by global warming) and Mounts <a href="http://garethrees.org/2009/08/31/canada/P1010040.JPG">Aberdeen</a>, Lefroy, and Victoria.

You took that at a colder time of year, I take it. Though there were still a few patches of snow visible high on the slopes of some of the mountains when we were there, not even counting the glaciers.

Yes, that was in mid-June. But the weather is really changeable and it can snow (or be sunny) at any time in the summer. Here's Ha Ling Peak (near Canmore) <a href="http://garethrees.org/2009/06/15/ha-ling-peak/P1010002.JPG">covered in snow</a> and <a href="http://garethrees.org/2009/06/15/ha-ling-peak/IMG_1373.JPG">a pleasant walk just three days later</a>. (And showing clearly the spectacular tilting of strata caused by the Rundle thrust fault.)

<p>That's a very dramatic change.</p>

<p>The strata were certainly evident when we were there. I saw on one of the signs an explanation that one can tell where in the Rockies one is by the tilt: in the central rockies, the layers are flat, but in the front ranges they can be very tilted, and farther on the extremes they are not so much tilted as crumpled.</p>

<p>It was also a bit of a surprise to me how easy it was to get around in the Banff area, as long as one sticks to the wide flat glacial valleys. I'm more used to the California coast ranges, in which the mountains and the roads through them can be extremely twisty. (<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=43.25835,86.308594&ie=UTF8&ll=39.801184,-123.808537&spn=0.020574,0.042143&t=h&z=15&iwloc=A">An example</a> in the north of California, that we drove a few weeks ago.) The Rockies have difficult terrain higher up, of course, but the difference is that the coast ranges don't have so much of the flat valley floors to use instead.</p>
