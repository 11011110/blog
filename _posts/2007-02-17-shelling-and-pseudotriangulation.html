<p>Random observation that I don't recall seeing before: the edges from the sequence of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Convex_shelling.svg">convex hulls of a shelling of a point set</a> forms a pointed pseudotriangulation: that is, it's a planar graph in which each interior face has three convex vertices and each vertex has one reflex angle.</p>

<p>But not every pointed pseudotriangulation can come from a shelling in this way: one can only have pseudotriangles with a single chain of reflex vertices, and there's some sort of acyclicity condition on the direction these chains can point. So the pseudotriangulations below do not come from shellings:</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/2007/unshell-pptri.svg" alt="Two pointed pseudotriangulations that do not come from shellings" /></p>

Since shellings are closely related to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimatroid">antimatroids</a>, and antimatroids are related to certain kinds of greedy algorithms, perhaps this connection can lead to some algorithms for finding optimal pseudotriangulations...

<p>Check out this <a href="http://valis.cs.uiuc.edu/~sariel/papers/02/ptriang/">writeup</a> - it might be remotely related. --S</p>

<p>I would have found this had you used the word "shelling"...</p>

<p>The degree restriction you use stops your version of this shelling process from forming an antimatroid, though: a point can be admissable, then stop being admissable because the removal of some other points increases its degree.</p>

<p>Also note that your tents are not exactly the same things as pseudotriangles; e.g. the central pseudotriangle in the pentagon in the left side of my figure is not a tent for any subset of the point set.</p>

<p>I said "remotely related" ;). Anyway, you can choose the vertex randomly, and then the result holds in expectation, removing the degree restriction.</p>
