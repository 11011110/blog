I&#x27;ve just put online a batch of <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/konstanz/index.html">photos from my recent visit</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konstanz">Konstanz, Germany</a>, where <a href="http://graphdrawing.org/gd2010/">GD 2010</a> was held.
<br />

<br />
Konstanz is located in southern Germany, on the Swiss border, where the Rhine leaves the Bodensee.
<br />

<br />

<br />
For some reason they have chosen to make their most prominent city monument, in the mouth of the harbor, be a 10 meter tall statue of a fictional prostitute, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperia_(statue)">Imperia</a>. She holds both Emperor Sigismund and Pope Martin V in the palms of her hands, figuratively in the Balzac story and literally in the statue; Sigismund and Martin both visited Konstanz in 1414â€“1418 for a different international symposium, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Constance">Council of Constance</a>.
<br />

<br />

<br />
The mesh in the GD2010 logo was made from a smaller model of the same statue in the artist&#x27;s back yard, as the big one was too difficult to scan.
<br />

<br />
Konstanz is also home to some other whimsical public art. The market street has a fountain commemorating the 1192 imperial charter of the city, with rabbitfish, birds in pope hats, and the like:

<br />

<br />
A pedestrian walkway in a busy traffic artery a little outside the center of town has another fountain, a monument to the seven deadly sins. The naked men staring at the naked woman are lust and pride respectively, and sloth and gluttony are also not hard to guess, but I&#x27;m not sure what the steering-wheel people are supposed to represent.
<br />

<br />
One feature that I found charming was the many buildings with names and pictures of the names over their doors.
<br />

<br />
Finally, here&#x27;s some more art, this time from a public square just around the corner from my hotel. The end of the conference was simultaneous with the start of a new wine festival in the square. The wine was served unfiltered, and the white tasted more like lemonade than wine, but it still had a bit of a kick. It went well with the onion bacon pizza things they were also serving.
