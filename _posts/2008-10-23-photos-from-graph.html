The Graph Drawing 2008 web site now has <a href="http://gd2008.org/photos/index.html">hundreds of photos</a> from the conference. Probably not of interest unless you were a participant. And the following more specific links are probably not of interest unless you&#x27;re me, but I found a few of myself <a href="http://gd2008.org/photos/pages/21.09.08%20(32).html">at the opening night reception with Maarten LÃ¶ffler</a>, <a href="http://gd2008.org/photos/pages/22.09.08%20(17).html">at a coffee break with Bettina Speckmann</a>, <a href="http://gd2008.org/photos/pages/22.09.08%20(31).html">watching the talks with Elena Mumford</a>, <a href="http://gd2008.org/photos/pages/22.09.08%20(34).html">giving my talks on xyz graphs</a> and <a href="http://gd2008.org/photos/pages/24.09.08%20(22).html">diamond lattices</a>, <a href="http://gd2008.org/photos/pages/24.09.08%20(2).html">chatting with Roberto Tamassia</a>, <a href="http://gd2008.org/photos/pages/24.09.08%20(34).html">outside the talk site with Alex Wolff</a>, and <a href="http://gd2008.org/photos/pages/Gala%2023.09.08%20(83).html">at the banquet</a>.
