<a href="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/44419">Metafilter</a> just linked to <a href="http://www.ambigram.matic.com/ambigram.htm">ambigram matic</a>, an automated web application for writing Roman-alphabet text so that it reads the same upside down.  Or alternatively so that it has a second different reading upside down.  It can only invert pairs of words with the same number of letters; obviously the method is to have a cross-table of upside-down pairs for each pair of Roman letters.  The results are a little unaesthetic compared to <a href="http://www.scottkim.com/inversions/index.html">Scott Kim&#x27;s inversions</a>, or even <a href="http://theory.csail.mit.edu/~edemaine/inversion.html">Scott Kim&#x27;s quicky sketches</a>, but what do you expect?

Re your ambigrams — thanks for the link, they&#x27;re good, though leaning more strongly towards aesthetics over legibility than many others I&#x27;ve seen.

I should have thought to search for that topic here — it&#x27;s at the obvious name, livejournal user ambigrams.  As I guess you knew, since you have several of the most recent posts at that comm.

Yea, I get most of my requests to be used as tattoos, and with tattoos most people have said it&#x27;s about looks primarily, and legibility secondary. I&#x27;ve found that many of mine turn out more legible than the usual ms paint versions i&#x27;ve seen around.
