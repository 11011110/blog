Suresh has been <a href="http://geomblog.blogspot.com/2007/06/socg-2007-geometric-views-of-learning.html">blogging</a> <a href="http://geomblog.blogspot.com/2007/06/socg-2007-approximate-clustering.html">up a</a> <a href="http://geomblog.blogspot.com/2007/06/socg-2007-magic-hausdorff-lions-have.html">storm</a> about SoCG, while instead I played hooky this afternoon to visit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seokguram">Seokguram</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulguksa">Bulguksa</a>. (Sadly, the light was grey and flat, so don&#x27;t expect photos, but both were definitely worth seeing in person.) Except for the difficulty of getting here, this has been a great location for a conference: a high quality hotel with reasonable rates, nearby restaurants with great food at low prices (my favorite so far: Bersayu, an excellent sit-on-the-floor barbecue dinner for about $6), decent espresso nearby albeit at high prices, and an impressive cultural heritage.

Anyway, here at least are the talk slides from my two talks yesterday: <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/EppGooSit-SoCG07-talk.pdf">Guard placement for wireless localization</a> (with Nodari Sitchinava and Mike Goodrich) and <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/Epp-SoCG-07-talk.pdf">Happy endings for flip graphs</a>.
