* [First code of conduct for a TCS conference](https://crypto.iacr.org/2018/codeofconduct.html) ([via](https://web.archive.org/web/20190210071123/https://plus.google.com/118250784898510714238/posts/D1jwNYWGxr4)). I think this is a move in the right direction.

* [Lattices with exponentially large kissing numbers](https://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2018/02/27/serge-vladut-lattices-with-exponentially-large-kissing-numbers/) ([G+](https://web.archive.org/web/20190210071041/https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/dU2Yzk1ZuMJ)). Gil Kalai describes [a new preprint by Serge Vlăduţ](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00886).

* [Earthmover distance](https://jeremykun.com/2018/03/05/earthmover-distance/), and why it might be relevant for gerrymandering-related computations.

* [UK academics reach the third week of a general strike over significant reduction in their retirement packages](http://crookedtimber.org/2018/03/05/44049/), while the [universities simultaneously call off negotiations and ask strikers to return to work while negotiations continue](http://www.bbc.com/news/education-43295334).

* [A regiment of monstrous functions](http://robjlow.blogspot.co.uk/2018/03/a-regiment-of-monstrous-functions.html) ([G+](https://web.archive.org/web/20190210070942/https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/i9i3kHoqti1)). Real-valued functions, even the ones defined by simple formulas, can behave badly.

* [Sir Robin](http://conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=3303) ([G+](https://web.archive.org/web/20190210070909/https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/VDgpeZ8hNVG)). A new and not-enormous spaceship in Conway's Game of Life that moves in the direction of a chess Knight at speed $$c/6$$. With later [in-depth discussion of how it was found](https://cp4space.wordpress.com/2018/03/11/a-rather-satisfying-winter/), and bonus unsolved problem in graph theory (on graphs in which each edge belongs to a unique triangle and each non-edge is the diagonal of a unique 4-cycle), potentially within reach of computation.

* [The Erdős paradox: When a mathematical number and Wikipedia collide](https://blog.wikimedia.org/2018/02/27/erdos-paradox/) ([via](https://web.archive.org/web/20190210070751/https://plus.google.com/+DaveThau/posts/eKtBuuWPmKk)). Interview with Kirsten Menger-Anderson on how (in [an essay](https://medium.com/@kma500/whos-important-a-tale-from-wikipedia-a370dc6ef078) I [linked earlier]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2018-02-15-linkage %})) she was led from Erdős numbers to missing women mathematicians on Wikipedia.

* [The rulers of the empire of the east try lipograms as a mass cultural word game](http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=36939). Because somehow that makes it harder to protest the removal of term limits.

* [Turning surface meshes in 3d into instructions for an automatic knitting machine](https://textiles-lab.github.io/publications/2018-autoknit/) ([via](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16536153), [via](https://boingboing.net/2018/03/08/observe-kniterate-repeat.html)). You would think that a tea cozy for the [Utah teapot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_teapot) would make a good test case, but no, they knitted the [Stanford bunny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_bunny) instead.

* [Chalkdust Issue 7](http://chalkdustmagazine.com/read/issue-07/). This British recreational mathematics magazine features articles on a set-theoretic road-trip game, the classic nine dots puzzle and its extensions, a Menger spongecake recipe, and more.

* [Sequence 300k for the OEIS](http://aperiodical.com/2018/03/the-oeis-now-contains-300000-integer-sequences/) ([G+](https://web.archive.org/web/20190210070450/https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/MhchvjHjpqv)). Beyond this milestone, the linked post includes some details about four nice new sequences.

* [Beall's list of predatory journals, resurrected](https://predatoryjournals.com/update/2017/01/24/welcome-to-predatory-journals.html) ([G+](https://web.archive.org/web/20190210070357/https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/6nBpsBMYd3B)). With some discussion of _IJCGA_ spam in the G+ post.
