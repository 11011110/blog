<p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.CG/0510024">Delta-Confluent Drawing</a>, my paper with Mike Goodrich and Jeremy Meng from Graph Drawing 2005, is now online at arxiv.org.</p>

<p>The main idea of the paper is to look at a restricted class of graph drawings, in which instead of edges there is a single track (like a train track) in the form of a tree with Y-junctions (in which two of the three tracks at the junction can connect to the third) and Delta-junctions (in which all three tracks can connect to each other); two vertices are connected to each other in the graph if there is a path connecting them through the junctions in the track.  It turns out that the graphs drawable in this way are exactly the distance-hereditary graphs.  Read the paper or <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/EppGooMen-GD-05.pdf">view the talk slides</a> for more details.</p>

<p>So far I've been uploading my graph drawing papers to arxiv, but, since it doesn't have a separate graph drawing category, I've been putting them in the computational geometry category.  There's a new <a href="http://gdea.informatik.uni-koeln.de/">graph drawing e-print archive</a>, for which we were given flyers at GD, so while I was uploading this paper I tried taking a look at it.  It does seem to have a lot of past GD papers online, <a href="http://gdea.informatik.uni-koeln.de/perl/search/simple?&author/editors=Eppstein">including half a dozen of mine</a>. (Abstracts and bibliography, anyway, but apparently not full text. How did they get there? Why don't people tell me these things? Who added the categories, and why did they think geometric thickness and Sugiyama-style layering are the same thing? How could one go about adding the full text to the existing abstract-only entries?)  Unfortunately, I couldn't find anything resembling an RSS feed for new papers.  Unless that appears, I'm unlikely to take much advantage of this resource.</p>
