<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.CG/0510024">Delta-Confluent Drawing</a>, my paper with Mike Goodrich and Jeremy Meng from Graph Drawing 2005, is now online at arxiv.org.
<br />

<br />
The main idea of the paper is to look at a restricted class of graph drawings, in which instead of edges there is a single track (like a train track) in the form of a tree with Y-junctions (in which two of the three tracks at the junction can connect to the third) and Delta-junctions (in which all three tracks can connect to each other); two vertices are connected to each other in the graph if there is a path connecting them through the junctions in the track.  It turns out that the graphs drawable in this way are exactly the distance-hereditary graphs.

So far I&#x27;ve been uploading my graph drawing papers to arxiv, but, since it doesn&#x27;t have a separate graph drawing category, I&#x27;ve been putting them in the computational geometry category.  There&#x27;s a new <a href="http://gdea.informatik.uni-koeln.de/">graph drawing e-print archive</a>, for which we were given flyers at GD, so while I was uploading this paper I tried taking a look at it.  It does seem to have a lot of past GD papers online, <a href="http://gdea.informatik.uni-koeln.de/perl/search/simple?&author/editors=Eppstein">including half a dozen of mine</a>. (Abstracts and bibliography, anyway, but apparently not full text. How did they get there? Why don&#x27;t people tell me these things? Who added the categories, and why did they think geometric thickness and Sugiyama-style layering are the same thing? How could one go about adding the full text to the existing abstract-only entries?)  Unfortunately, I couldn&#x27;t find anything resembling an RSS feed for new papers.  Unless that appears, I&#x27;m unlikely to take much advantage of this resource.
