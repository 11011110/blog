Found out today (via <a href="http://www.neilgaiman.com/journal/2005/08/signing-tour-keplers-rip.asp">Neil Gaiman</a>) that <a href="http://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/show_story.php?id=1707">Kepler&#x27;s is closing</a>.  I no longer live near Menlo Park, but I&#x27;d shopped there many times.  One less good independent bookstore in the world.  One more step towards the complete domination of our culture by corporate homogeneity.

Now I feel guilty for all my Amazon purchases.  They just celebrated their fiftieth anniversary, I think, not too long ago.
  
The Tiki Bar close to it is still popular.  Or you can buy a latte at Cafe Borrone [to be pronounced &quot;Bore-One&quot;].  Coffee is thriving.

When all books started getting barcodes it was the beginning of the end
