I&#x27;ve finally found time to finish processing the <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/mendocino7/">photos from my recent visit to Mendocino</a>. I&#x27;ve sorted them into five subdirectories, three of which are mostly family snapshots. The two that aren&#x27;t are <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/mendocino7/j4p/">my photos from the July 4th parade</a> and <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/mendocino7/ptcab/">half a dozen views of the Pt. Cabrillo lighthouse</a>.
<br />

<br />
Also, with the parade photos, I experimented in the raw conversions with setting the contrast significantly lower than I normally would, and boosting the saturation to match, so that more dynamic range is visible than normally would be with that kind of lighting. Seems to have worked pretty well to my eye...
<br />

<br />
Still to come as I continue working through the backlog: blackberry picking and some shots of the Bren Hall construction.
