<p>I haven't been paying so much attention to the <a href="http://blogcarnival.com/bc/cprof_1049.html">carnival of mathematics</a> lately, so I've skipped some issues â€” it seems we're already up to <a href="http://jd2718.wordpress.com/2009/01/18/carnival-of-mathematics-47-where-no-well/">Number 47</a> (the Star Trek edition).</p>

<p>Two of the entries caught my attention. First, <a href="http://polymathematics.typepad.com/polymath/why-is-the-incenter-the-nagel-point-of-the-medial-triangle.html">the incenter is the Nagel point of the medial triangle</a>. This was known (and there are many similar ways of deriving one triangle center as a different center of a related triangle) but <a href="http://polymathematics.typepad.com/polymath/">The Advanced High School Math Project</a> supplies a proof.</p>

<p>And second, <a href="http://quomodocumque.wordpress.com/2009/01/10/blogging-my-orphans-n-points-in-the-plane-with-no-three-collinear/">Quomodocumque</a> gets into some deep water attempting to <a href="https://oeis.org/A063666">count</a> the <a href="http://www.ist.tugraz.at/staff/aichholzer/research/rp/triangulations/ordertypes/">order-types of planar point sets</a>.</p>
