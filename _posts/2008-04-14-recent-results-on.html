title:  'Recent (?) results on the complexity of combinatorial games'

I&#x27;m way behind on reading arXiv postings (and other recent papers, for that matter, other than what I&#x27;ve had to for various program committees), but I&#x27;ve kept pointers to some interesting older ones in hopes of catching up later. The three here don&#x27;t really go very far towards catching up, but they&#x27;re at least a start.
<br />

<br />
<b><i>The three-color and two-color Tantrix rotation puzzle problems are NP-complete via parsimonious reductions</i></b>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0711.1827">arXiv:0711.1827</a>, Baumeister and Rothe. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tantrix">Tantrix</a> is a puzzle in which one rotates hexagonal tiles in order to match up the colors on the edges of the tiles. The four-color version was already known to be hard; this paper extends the proof to versions of fewer colors. The part in the title about parsimony means that, if the SAT problem being reduced to a Tantrix puzzle has a unique solution, so does the Tantrix puzzle. Therefore, one can use this sort of reduction to reason about puzzle solvers that make deductions based on the assumption that there is a unique solution: since SAT with unique solutions remains difficult (<a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=22101.22108">Valiant and Vazirani 1986</a>), Tantrix problems having a unique solution are difficult too.

<b><i>Phutball is PSPACE-hard</i></b>, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.1777">arXiv:0804.1777</a>, Dereniowski. It&#x27;s hard to see from the rules of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phutball">Phutball</a> how either player could make any progress at all, but when I played a stronger player once years ago I lost miserably â€” there&#x27;s quite a bit of skill to it. The proper complexity class is EXPTIME-complete, I think, but PSPACE-hard is a lot closer to that than my previous <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.CC/0008025/">NP-completeness proof for testing whether you have an immediate win</a>.

<b><i>Best play in Fanorona leads to a draw</i></b>, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/9789812709677_0243">DOI:10.1142/9789812709677_0243</a>, Schadd et al. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanorona">Fanorona</a> is a classical and interesting checkers-like game from Madagascar. Here the authors mean best play from the starting position, but classical match play in this game involves starting with several different opening moves and I don&#x27;t think they solved them all. As is typical for this sort of result, the authors combine a forward search (from the starting position) with an exhaustive retrograde search of all endgames up to 7 pieces. <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/180a/projects/fanorona/">My Fanorona web applet</a> uses a similar strategy (with a smaller endgame database), and while far from perfect is very hard to beat at the higher levels (be sure to click ok after setting the level).
