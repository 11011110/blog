I just posted a new question on cstheory.stackexchange.com: <a href="http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/7717/complexity-of-finding-the-smallest-well-covered-completion">how hard is it to find the smallest well-covered graph containing a given graph G as an induced subgraph?</a> I suspect the answer is that it&#x27;s Î£<sub>2</sub>-complete, but I don&#x27;t know of a proof.
