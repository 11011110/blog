<p>I just posted a new question on cstheory.stackexchange.com: <a href="http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/7717/complexity-of-finding-the-smallest-well-covered-completion">how hard is it to find the smallest well-covered graph containing a given graph G as an induced subgraph?</a> I suspect the answer is that it's \( \Sigma_2 \)-complete, but I don't know of a proof.</p>
