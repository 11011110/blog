<a href="http://golly.sourceforge.net/">New cross-platform cellular automata application</a> by Tomas Rokicki and Andrew Trevorrow.

And while I&#x27;m posting pointers to Game of Life stuff, <a href="http://gameoflife-news.blogspot.com/">H. Koenig&#x27;s Game of Life News blog</a> is a great new resource.
