The <a href="http://www.gd2012.org/gd2012poster.pdf">poster for Graph Drawing 2012</a> (in September in Redmond, Washington) is out, and it looks like they&#x27;re using a <a href="http://11011110.livejournal.com/201066.html">Lombardi Spirograph</a> drawing of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nauru_graph">Nauru graph</a> as a central design element.
<br />

<br />
The submission deadline is June 8, less than two months away, so there&#x27;s still time to come up with new graph drawing ideas and write them up for the conference. The <a href="http://www.gd2012.org/">conference web site</a> has more information.
