<p>Kind of an old link, but before I lose it again: <a href="http://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/05/16/1256213">slashdot thread on the problem of making change with as few coins as possible</a>.  Including pointers to Shallit's research on coin systems minimizing the expected number of coins, and some discussion of why, in general, greedy algorithms don't work for optimal change-making and instead dynamic programming may be required.</p>

<p>I believe one of Dennis Shasha's puzzle columns for Scientific American a few years back also posed the same problem. I am not sure if he knew of Shalit's work, or vice-versa.</p>

<b>None</b>: Four coin \( \{1,a,b,c\} \)  asymptotics, anyone?<br />

<p>Quite awhile ago I sent a problem to the American Math Monthly <a href="http://www.plambeck.org/oldhtml/mathematics/coinchanging/coinchangingproblem.pdf">asking for the asymptotic number of greedy-optimal \( \{1,a,b\} \) coin sets</a>.  I've tried to work out four coin asymptotics more than once without success, but have never been able to interest anyone else in the problem...so, here's another chance, everyone!</p>

<p>Presumably this long since appeared in the Monthly answers...</p>

<p>I calculated the probability that \( \{1,a,b\} \) (chosen randomly from pairs \( \le n \)) is greedy-optimal to be \( \frac{8}{3} n^{-1/2} \) (plus lower order terms), but the calculation was messy enough that I likely made a mistake somewhere.</p>

<p>It appears to be the case (e.g. applying Lemma 1 of <a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=321961">Chang and Korsh, JACM 1976</a>) that \( \{1,a,b\} \) is greedy-optimal iff \( a\le(b\bmod a)+\lfloor b/a\rfloor \).  The messy part is calculating how many pairs \( a,b \) satisfy that inequality.</p>

<p>No idea how to extend this to \( \{1,a,b,c\} \).</p>

<p>Nope, no mistake, that's it, 8/3 etc, I'm pretty sure.</p>
