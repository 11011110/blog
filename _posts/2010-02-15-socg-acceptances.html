<p><a href="http://geomblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/socg-accepted-papers.html">Suresh just posted the list of accepted papers at SoCG</a>, and promises to start adding links to online copies of the papers. I have one in there; I already posted about it <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/2009/12/03/orthogonal-polyhedra.html">here</a> (and, sort of, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/2009/12/04/paper-permutohedron.html">here</a>).</p>
