The local softball season&#x27;s winding down: only three games left until playoffs. In order to get a first-round bye, the teams need to be in the top three of their five-team division, and it&#x27;s looking likely that Sara&#x27;s team will be either second or third.  Due to all the rain delays we expected to have to play four games this weekend, but one was canceled and Sara missed another due to a school dance.  So, a few photos from the remaining two games: <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/riptide/th/index.html">Thunder</a> and <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/riptide/sz/index.html">Sub-Zero</a>.
