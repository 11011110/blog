* Two sites on toroidal polyhedra: [Bonnie Stewarts Hohlkörper](https://www.spektrum.de/alias/raeumliche-geometrie/bonnie-stewarts-hohlkoerper/681891) and [Alex Doskey's virtual reality models of Stewart's polyhedra](http://polyhedra.doskey.com/Stewart00.html) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/104618649607830730)). Found while researching a new WP article on Stewart's book _[Adventures Among the Toroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventures_Among_the_Toroids)_. The first link is in German but readable through Google translate and has lots of pretty pictures. The second needs VR software to be usable.

* [The map folding problem, illustrated by Robert Dickau](https://www.robertdickau.com/mapfolding.html) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/104630030819531499)). See [Dickau's home page](https://www.robertdickau.com/default.html#math) for many more mathematical illustrations, mostly of combinatorial enumeration problems and fractals.

* For some reason I wanted the name of a surface of revolution of a circular arc less than $$\pi$$ around its chord ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/104635297508909080)). [Wikipedia said "lemon"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon_(geometry)) but sourced to MathWorld so I thought maybe MathWorld had made it up. Not so. Better sources say the same. And the surface for the complementary arc is an "apple". It looks like a North American football but [a "football" is a different surface of revolution, of constant positive Gaussian curvature](http://modellsammlung.uni-goettingen.de/index.php?lang=en&r=5&sr=17&m=182).

* [Special issue of _Discrete & Computational Geometry_ in memory of Branko Grünbaum](https://link.springer.com/journal/454/64/2) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/104643955543481823)). I think many of the research papers in it are interesting but I want to draw particular attention to [the preface by Gil Kalai, Bojan Mohar, and Isabella Novik](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00454-020-00214-y), which provides a nice brief survey both of Grünbaum's many contributions to discrete geometry and of the lines of active research they have led to.

* [2020 Bridges Conference Mathematical Art Gallery](http://gallery.bridgesmathart.org/exhibitions/2020-Bridges-Conference) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/104646771923669610)). Many are great but a couple of my favorites are [Conan Chadbourne's grid partition enumeration](http://gallery.bridgesmathart.org/exhibitions/2020-bridges-conference/conan-chadbourne) and [Martin Levin's ten-tetrahedron tensegrity](http://gallery.bridgesmathart.org/exhibitions/2020-bridges-conference/mdlevin_publicmsncom). I didn't participate but apparently the Bridges conference itself was held virtually a few days ago; see [the conference site](https://2020.bridgesmathart.org/) for more including papers and videos.

* [Paper plotter](https://felixboiii.github.io/paper-plotter/) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/104655233453519187), [via](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24091297)): tool to make 3d paper cut-and-assemble models of the graphs of bivariate functions.

* Kowhaiwhai ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/104663925881930344)).  are repeating decorative patterns used in New Zealand on Maori buildings. [The National Library of NZ has a number of good examples](https://natlib.govt.nz/photos?text=kowhaiwhai&commit=Search), including the [sketches of patterns by Tamati Ngakoho (top) and of a traditional Arawa pattern (bottom)](https://natlib.govt.nz/records/23146518) shown below. There's also [a brief guide to their interpretation online](http://www.maori.org.nz/whakairo/default.php?pid=sp55&parent=52). I can't find much analysis of their structure, though, beyond pointing to frieze groups for their symmetries. The part that interests me more is their fractal-like swooping structure, reminiscent of (and in some cases directly modeled on) fern fronds.

* [Why Wikipedia decided to stop calling Fox a reliable source](https://www.wired.com/story/why-wikipedia-decided-to-stop-calling-fox-a-reliable-source/) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/104666160845673755)). Note however that Fox has not actually been deemed unreliable, in general. [The discussion had a no-consensus close](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard/Archive_303#RfC:_Fox_News).

* [Untangling random polygons](https://sinews.siam.org/Details-Page/untangling-random-polygons-and-other-things) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/104677553383067578)): repeatedly rescaling midpoint polygons always leads to an ellipse.

* [The mesmerizing geometry of Malaysia’s most complex cakes:
Bold colors and designs set kek lapis Sarawak apart](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/kek-lapis-sarawak) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/104680812259935603), [via](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24116775)). As seen on The Great British Bake Off. These cakes have many parallel layers in bright colors, cut and rearranged to form complex designs. Mostly they involve 45 and 90-degree angles but at least one of the examples uses hexagonal symmetry instead.

* My Google Scholar profile has mildly broken down ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/104683176033821672)). When I go there, it offers me two new profiles to link as my coauthors: Man-Kwun Chiu and Matí Korman. They are indeed coauthors, from my new CCCG papers. But when I click to accept them as listed coauthors, it tells me I have too many coauthors, refuses to add them, and returns to offering me new profiles to link. I can see no way out of this other than to not accept my coauthors, which would be wrong. Google, fix this limitation!

* A use for old CDs: [cut them up and glue the pieces together to make visualizations of great circle arrangements on the sphere](https://momath.org/home/math-monday-those-circles-are-great/) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/104690896919723051)). The mathematical question posed by this is: for which numbers of great circles is it possible to make an arrangement in which all the arcs between pairs of neighbors have equal lengths?

* [The Renaissance Mathematicus](https://thonyc.wordpress.com/) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@pkra/104694183591138626)), an interesting blogger on the history of science. See also the [crowdfunding drive to replace their old creaky iMac](https://thonyc.wordpress.com/2020/08/15/keep-the-renaissance-mathematicus-online/), from which I found this.
