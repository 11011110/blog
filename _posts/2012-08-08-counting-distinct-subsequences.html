title:  'Counting distinct subsequences'

<p>Here's a nice dynamic programming exercise: find a polynomial-time algorithm that takes as input a sequence of \( n \) symbols, and a number \( k, \) and produces as output the number of distinct \( k \)-character subsequences.</p>

<p>For instance, if the input is the string "food" and the number \( k=2, \) the output should be \( 4. \) There are four distinct two-character subsequences of "food": they are "fo", "fd", "oo", and "od".</p>

Let \( \theta(S,k) \) be the number of distinct <i>k</i>-character subsequences in the string \( S=s_1\dots s_n. \) Clearly \( \theta(S,k)=1 \) if \( n=k \) or \( k=0 \) and \( \theta(S,k)=0 \) if \( n\lt k. \) Otherwise, suppose that \( S \) contains \( m \) distinct characters \( c_1, \dots, c_m \) such that \( c_i \) first appears in \( S \) at position \( p(i). \) Then
\[
\theta(S,k) = \sum \theta(s_{p(i)+1}\dots s_n, k-1).
\]
This can be computed by dynamic programming in time \( O(n^2 k). \)

So in your example,
\[
\begin{align*}
\theta(\text{"food"}, 2) &= \theta(\text{"ood"}, 1) + \theta(\text{"od"}, 1) + \theta(\text{""}, 1)\\
&= (\theta(\text{"od"}, 0) + \theta(\text{""}, 0)) + (\theta(\text{"d"}, 0) + \theta(\text{""}, 0)) + 0\\
&= (1 + 1) + (1 + 1)\\
&= 4.
\end{align*}
\]

Yes. I had a slightly different formulation in which I was counting the number of sets of \( k \) positions, ending at some position \( i, \) that are the lexicographically-first set of positions for the string they form. But I think it amounts to the same thing.

<p>Cute! Do you know about the problem of finding the most common subsequence? For example in AAABBBCCC, the most common subsequence is ABC, which occurs 27 times.</p>

<p>I found a couple of external links related to the problem that you mentioned, but not this other one:
http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304397508006245
http://www.spoj.pl/problems/CSUBSEQS/</p>

<p>It would be nice to put this in P or NPC. I'm also wondering:
- there might be a tie for the most common subsequence (there are 4 in OOZE that appear twice) but is the longest of the most common ones unique?
- is this map unimodal?: \( L \) â†’ maximum frequency of any length-\( L \) subsequence</p>

<p>I didn't know about that problem before your comment, but it looks like an interesting one. Maybe worth asking again on http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/? I wouldn't be surprised if it turns out to be NPC, though.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply, I have disproved my structural questions and posted the remaining main problem here: <a href="http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/12307/commonest-subsequence">http://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/12307/commonest-subsequence</a></p>

<p>I voted +1 for your question there. Are the counterexamples for the structural questions easy to describe?</p>

<p>"12312312" disproves unimodality, since the maximums for length two to four are are 6 "12"s, 4 of several length-3 strings, and 5 of several length-4 strings</p>

<p>"crash after this" disproves uniqueness of the longest most frequent one, since the max frequency is 4, but there are two longest ones 'cra this' and 'crafthis'</p>

<p>I didn't try to distill them much, beyond finding them, though.</p>
