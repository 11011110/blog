<p><a href="http://3dpancakes.typepad.com/ernie/2006/04/soda_2007.html">Jeff</a> and <a href="http://geomblog.blogspot.com/2006/04/soda-2007.html">Suresh</a> point to the newly released <a href="http://www.siam.org/meetings/da07/">SODA call for papers</a>. There's plenty of time between it and the <a href="http://focs06.cs.princeton.edu/cfp.html">FOCS notifications</a>, so one can submit to FOCS (next week! where does the time go?) without foreclosing the option for SODA in case FOCS's random number generator goes against you.</p>

<p>I was also amused to see that <a href="http://geomblog.blogspot.com/2006/04/soda-2007.html">SODA short papers are a tool of Voldemort</a>, so it's a very good thing they were abolished.</p>
