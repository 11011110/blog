Have had this on my bookmarks for quite a while, but here seems a better place to save the link: <a href="http://hereswhatsleft.typepad.com/home/2004/12/conservative_ar.html">Conservative Art II; Kinkade vs. Friedrich</a>.  Even if we ignore the metaphor of art for politics, Heather and Michael do a much better job than I could of analyzing what&#x27;s wrong with commercial fine art such as Kinkade&#x27;s, by way of a comparison between a piece by Friedrich and Kinkade&#x27;s rip-off of same: &quot;His art is a paltry and more easily digestible weak misreading of basic tropes that have been around for a long time.  It is done with the intention of not requiring thought, and perhaps enforcing a lack thereof.&quot;
