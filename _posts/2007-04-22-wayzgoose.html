Yesterday was Celebrate UCI / Wayzgoose, an annual festival held in the middle of the UCI campus with several stages for music, dance, and other shows, demonstrations of fighting by the Society for Creative Anachronism and related groups, a vintage car show, Earth Day exhibits, a fun fair for the kids, and lots of student groups setting up booths and selling food. <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/wayzgoose07/">My photos</a> for this year were mainly of the car show and medieval fighting, though.
