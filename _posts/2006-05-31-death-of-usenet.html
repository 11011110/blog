It looks from the file mod dates that it&#x27;s been nine months since I last read anything on Usenet.  The date I stopped roughly coincides with my last trip to Europe; I didn&#x27;t have time on that trip to keep up with my usual net reading, and when I came back the huge pile of mostly-uninteresting messages waiting for me was too big a barrier for me to get back into it.  In the bigger picture, web forums weren&#x27;t enough to make me drift away from Usenet, but RSS and blogs were. I wonder if anything I&#x27;d regret missing has been posted there since...

Well no wonder no one ever replied to my post on <em>comp.theory</em> asking about the mathematics behind Sudoku! (If you&#x27;re curious, take a look <a href="http://www.learningcomputation.com/blog/2006/01/math-and-sudoku.html">here</a>.) But aside from that, you probably haven&#x27;t missed too much.

Although I have a weak spot for flawed P vs. NP proofs and the like, I have to admit that I spend a lot more time reading blogs than Usenet posts nowadays.
