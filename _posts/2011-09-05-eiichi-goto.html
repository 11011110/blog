<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiichi_Goto">Eiichi Goto</a> (1931â€“2005), one of the pioneers of computer science in Japan.
<br />

I didn&#x27;t end up putting it into the article, but there&#x27;s an amusing story about his name in one of the references. A very famous paper by Dijkstra about programming language design had the title &quot;Goto considered harmful&quot;, about which Knuth is said to have remarked, &quot;Dr. Goto cheerfully complained that he was always being eliminated.&quot;

You mean, am I doing this to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name-dropping">name-drop</a>? No, not really. I&#x27;m just trying to call attention to the new content I&#x27;ve been adding to Wikipedia.

Not at all. I just wanted to call attention to the fact that &#x27;Goto&#x27; is a good name for a computer scientist.
