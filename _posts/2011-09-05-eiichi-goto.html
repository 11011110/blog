<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiichi_Goto">Eiichi Goto</a> (1931â€“2005), one of the pioneers of computer science in Japan.</p>

<p>I didn't end up putting it into the article, but there's an amusing story about his name in one of the references. A very famous paper by Dijkstra about programming language design had the title "Goto considered harmful", about which Knuth is said to have remarked, "Dr. Goto cheerfully complained that he was always being eliminated."</p>

You mean, am I doing this to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name-dropping">name-drop</a>? No, not really. I'm just trying to call attention to the new content I've been adding to Wikipedia.

Not at all. I just wanted to call attention to the fact that 'Goto' is a good name for a computer scientist.
