<p><a href="http://www.graphdrawing.org/gd2010/invited.html">Videos from the invited talks at GD 2010</a> are now available online. So if you wanted to go to GD but couldn't, you can still see those parts at least. Carsten Thomassen spoke about partitioning the edges of a graph into small isomorphic subgraphs (so graph theory rather than graph drawing, although there are close connections to Schnyder labelings and thence to grid embeddings of planar graphs) and Peter Eades spoke on the future of graph drawing.</p>
