I have another new paper up on arXiv, titled &quot;<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/math.MG/0612109">Manhattan orbifolds</a>&quot;. It&#x27;s about 2-dimensional manifolds with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injective_metric_space">hyperconvex metrics</a>, which is to say that they have properties similar to L<sub>âˆž</sub> metrics in <b>R</b><sup>n</sup>.
<br />

<br />
The original idea was that these things might be useful in designing approximation algorithms for the hyperbolic plane, related to my <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.CG/0604034">squarepants</a> paper. But, though the paper does describe a hyperconvex approximation to the hyperbolic plane, I haven&#x27;t yet found any approximation algorithms based on it, and there isn&#x27;t really any algorithmic content in the paper. Instead it turned into something about distances in graphs (squaregraphs, which are a type of partial cube, and certain other related graphs).
