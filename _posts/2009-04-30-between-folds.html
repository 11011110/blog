<p>I just came back from seeing <a href="http://www.greenfusefilms.com/">Between the Folds</a>, a beautiful feature-length documentary film on the art and science of origami, at the Newport Beach Film Festival, featuring star turns by, among others, <b><a href="http://tomster0.livejournal.com/"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/lj-userinfo.gif" alt="[info]" width="17" height="17" style="vertical-align: bottom; border: 0;" />tomster0</a></b> and Erik and Marty Demaine. My kids were laughing at loud at Paul Jackson's description of three-legged elephants (part of a rant about realism in art) and my wife was nodding in recognition at Erik's description of how excited one gets when one first solves a hard problem and how likely one's initial solution is to be wrong. I guess it's still on the film festival tour, so you'll have to figure out where it's playing next or wait to see it on DVD, but I highly recommend it.</p>

<p><b>ETA 1/1/10</b>: <a href="http://www.shoppbs.org/product/index.jsp?productId=3839146">Now out on DVD</a> after showing on PBS. I missed most of the showing but fortunately caught enough of the tail end to find the ordering information.</p>
