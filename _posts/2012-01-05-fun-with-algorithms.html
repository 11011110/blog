<p>Since 1998, every three years, there has been an International Conference on Fun With Algorithms in a scenic seaside Italian location. This year is only two years since the previous one, but <a href="http://www.dsi.unive.it/~fun2012/">they're having it anyway</a>, on an island in Venice. I'm on the program committee, and the deadline is January 15, less than two weeks away.</p>

<p>So if you have a paper or an idea for a paper somehow relating algorithms to <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/2012/01/04/sudoku-puzzles-with.html">popular puzzles</a>, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/2011/12/14/sorting-algorithms-demonstrated.html">folk dancing</a>, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/2011/10/16/tron-motorcycle-game.html">smiley face graph drawing</a>, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/2009/12/04/paper-permutohedron.html">paper folding</a>, or other fun topics, hurry up, write it, and send it in!</p>

<p>ETA: The submission date has been extended to January 23.</p>
