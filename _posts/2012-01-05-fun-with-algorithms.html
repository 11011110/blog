Since 1998, every three years, there has been an International Conference on Fun With Algorithms in a scenic seaside Italian location. This year is only two years since the previous one, but <a href="http://www.dsi.unive.it/~fun2012/">they&#x27;re having it anyway</a>, on an island in Venice. I&#x27;m on the program committee, and the deadline is January 15, less than two weeks away.
<br />

<br />
So if you have a paper or an idea for a paper somehow relating algorithms to <a href="http://11011110.livejournal.com/239482.html">popular puzzles</a>, <a href="http://11011110.livejournal.com/236987.html">folk dancing</a>, <a href="http://11011110.livejournal.com/232731.html">smiley face graph drawing</a>, <a href="http://11011110.livejournal.com/186752.html">paper folding</a>, or other fun topics, hurry up, write it, and send it in!
<br />

<br />
ETA: The submission date has been extended to January 23.
