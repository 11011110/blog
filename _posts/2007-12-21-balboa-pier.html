As our annual way to get into the Christmas spirit, we went last Sunday to the Newport Beach parade of lights, in which the boats are all decorated with fancy lights and parade around the harbor in front of a lot of very expensive houses that are also decorated with fancy lights. I didn&#x27;t keep any pictures of the parade itself this time, though my daughter did. A few of hers even came out not ridiculously blurry. So if you want to see some you&#x27;ll have to make do with my <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/boatparade/index.html">photos</a> from <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/boatparade03/index.html">past</a> years <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/bp06/index.html">instead</a>. I did take a few photos at the Balboa Pier, where we went for a quick dinner before the parade started, though, including a couple of takes on my annual Christmas photo of the kids and some others of the nice sunset light. <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/bp07/index.html">Gallery online here</a>.
