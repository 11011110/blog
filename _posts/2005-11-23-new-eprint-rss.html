Good news if you want to pay attention to graph drawing research: the <a href="http://gdea.informatik.uni-koeln.de/">Graph Drawing Epreint Archive (GDEA)</a> now has an RSS feed.  As (via <b><a href="http://ephermata.livejournal.com/"><img src="http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif" alt="[info]" width="17" height="17" style="vertical-align: bottom; border: 0;" />ephermata</a></b>) does the <a href="http://eprint.iacr.org/rss/ ">International Association for Cryptographic Research (IACR) eprint archive</a>.
<br />

<br />
Not sure how I feel about the proliferation of specialized archives (as opposed to more comprehensive ones like <a href="http://arxiv.org/">arxiv</a>) but this will make it a lot easier to keep up with them.

in principle maybe there could be a tie up between the arxiv and the graph drawing repository at least for search purposes. I agree that balkanizing eprint archives is not great, but at least the culture is growing.
