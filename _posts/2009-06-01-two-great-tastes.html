Boing Boing is showing a great information visualization concerning a case in which a college president has been accused of plagiarising his Ph.D. thesis, <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2009/06/01/what-plagiarism-look.html">here</a>. It consists of nothing more sophisticated than a yellow highlighter and a grid of thumbnail images of pages, but I think it conveys the message very effectively.
