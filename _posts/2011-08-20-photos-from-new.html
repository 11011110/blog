What, nearly six days in New York City and I only brought back <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/nyc/index.html">five photos</a>? Well, no, actually there&#x27;s another set that I haven&#x27;t processed yet. The ones in this set include a couple from MoMA, one of the Statue of Liberty from the WADS dinner cruise, and a couple from the Brooklyn Heights Promenade.
<br />

There would also have been photos of the <a href="http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/exhibitions/on-view/lee-ufan">Lee Ufan exhibit</a> and of <a href="http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/exhibitions/on-view/hugo-boss-prize-2010">Hans-Peter Feldmann&#x27;s room wallpapered with 100,000 $1 bills</a>  from the Guggenheim if only they allowed photography. It&#x27;s a lot smaller of a museum than MoMA but definitely worth seeing.
