<p>What, nearly six days in New York City and I only brought back <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/nyc/index.html">five photos</a>? Well, no, actually there's another set that I haven't processed yet. The ones in this set include a couple from MoMA, one of the Statue of Liberty from the WADS dinner cruise, and a couple from the Brooklyn Heights Promenade.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/nyc/PhotographerPhotographsPhotos.html"><img src="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/nyc/PhotographerPhotographsPhotos-m.jpg" alt="Photographer photographs photos" style="border-style:solid;border-color:black;" /></a></p>

<p>There would also have been photos of the <a href="http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/exhibitions/on-view/lee-ufan">Lee Ufan exhibit</a> and of <a href="http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/exhibitions/on-view/hugo-boss-prize-2010">Hans-Peter Feldmann's room wallpapered with 100,000 $1 bills</a>  from the Guggenheim if only they allowed photography. It's a lot smaller of a museum than MoMA but definitely worth seeing.</p>
