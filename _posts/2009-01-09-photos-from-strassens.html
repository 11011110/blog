<p>I&#x27;ve now put my <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/strassen/">photos from Volker Strassen&#x27;s Knuth Prize lecture at SODA</a> online. I&#x27;ve also uploaded two of them to Wikimedia and used them to illustrate the Wikipedia articles for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volker_Strassen">Strassen</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth_Prize">Knuth Prize</a>; if anyone has a need for a freely-licensed version of any of the other photos, I&#x27;d be happy to upload them there as well.</p>

<p>I already have something of a tradition of recording <a href="http://11011110.livejournal.com/15099.html">limericks that people have included in their technical talks</a>, so, for the record, Strassen&#x27;s was:</p>

<blockquote>
An E.T. residing on Vega<br />
determined the size of ω.<br />
  In Praha, at night,<br />
  he told me that quite<br />
positively ω was nega....
</blockquote>
<p>In the following slide, he encoded a conjecture that ω (the exponent in the time bound for matrix multiplication) is strictly greater than two into another poem. Fortunately, the quality of the poetry provided a lower bound, rather than an upper bound, on the quality of the rest of his talk.</p>
