<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_C._Fischer#Biography">Patrick C. Fischer</a>, founder of SIGACT and of STOC. Somehow I think that&#x27;s a more important accomplishment than the one the newspapers all focused on, being the target of the Unabomber. It surprised me a bit that someone with such a distinguished academic career didn&#x27;t already have a Wikipedia article, but now he does.
