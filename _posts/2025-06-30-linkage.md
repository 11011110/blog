!["The Urchin Merchant", Street art in Westside Santa Cruz, California by Lauren Ys, 2021, part of PangeaSeed Foundation's Sea Walls: Artists for Oceans project. A mural decorates a keystone-shaped building, set against a dark blue sky. At center, a young woman with asian features representing an anthropomorphized starfish wears long flowing sleeves and a headdress decorated with sea anemones, sea urchins, starfish, and kelp. She holds a sea urchin, from which a bite appears to have been removed; a sea otter dances in an abalone shell in front of her. She is flanked by two floating mermaids with sharp teeth and fingernails, representing, left, an anthropomorphized sea urchin, and right, an anthropomorphized leopard shark. The urchin mermaid floats above a large sea urchin, has bright blue skin and braided hair, and wears red lipstick and punk clothing and chains with a spiky helmet. Safety pinned to her chest is a small poster reading "eat me". She is eating kelp with chopsticks, and holds another kelp stalk in her other hand. The leopard shark mermaid has mottled purple skin, large eyes at the ends of stalks on the side of her face, pinned-up dark blue hair, and lipstick matching her hair; she wears a fishnet top, a spiked bracelet on her right wrist, and a starfish on her right bicep. The background is pink, decorated with light purple silhouettes of sea urchins and kelp. A white van parked at lower right obscures the leopard shark mermaid's lower torso.](https://ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/scws/TheUrchinMerchant-m.jpg){: style="border-style:solid;border-color:black" }

From the abstract: "EEG revealed significant differences in brain connectivity ... LLM users displayed the weakest connectivity. ... Self-reported ownership of essays was the lowest in the LLM group ... LLM users also struggled to accurately quote their own work. ... LLM users consistently underperformed at neural, linguistic, and behavioral levels. These results raise concerns about the long-term educational implications of LLM reliance and underscore the need for deeper inquiry into AI's role in learning."

The problem is: when you see an object reflected in a cylindrical or spherical mirror, where on the mirror does it appear? This was already notoriously hard by the late middle ages. It can be solved (after reducing to a circular mirror cross-section) by intersecting a hyperbola with the mirror, or with a quartic equation, but not by compass and straightedge.

![Huygens' solution of Alhazen's problem.by intersection with a hyperbola. Two blue points outside a circular mirror (black) are connected to each other by the blue path  of a reflected light ray from one to the other. A red rectangular hyperbola crosses the mirror at the reflection point. Several points and lines used to construct the hyperbola are depicted in yellow: two rays from the center of the circle through the two blue points, the angle bisector of these rays and its perpendicular line through the center of the circle, two yellow points on the rays formed by circle inversion of the blue points through the mirror, the midpoint of these two inverse points, and two more yellow lines through the midpoint, parallel to the angle bisector and its perpendicular. The red hyperbola is asymptotic to these two lines through the midpoint and passes through the two inverse points.]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/2025/Alhazen-hyperbola.svg)

  You know those [curved patterns of light (caustics) that you see in the bottom of coffee cups](https://chalkdustmagazine.com/features/cardioids-coffee-cups/) outside in the sun? They are also very relevant for this problem. If you had a point light source inside your cup instead of far away, the caustic would separate points with two reflected images of the light source (on the dark side of the caustic) from points with four (on the bright side). With the sun outside the cup, you will instead get one or three reflection paths off the side of your cup onto its bottom (some of which may be blocked by the opposite side of the cup), but the underlying principle is the same.

  A minor technical problem I ran into when creating the hyperbola illustration above ([source code](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Alhazen_hyperbola.svg)): the svg format does not have a direct representation for hyperbolae so instead you have to approximate them with splines. But although calculating points on a hyperbola is very easy, choosing control points with splines is not. I ended up adding a polycurve routine to [my Python SVG library](https://ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/PADS/SVG.py) to smooth a curve through given points automatically.
