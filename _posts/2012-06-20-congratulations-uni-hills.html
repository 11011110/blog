It&#x27;s that time of year again, and my daughter Sara is one of this year&#x27;s high school graduates, among 30 or so from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_Hills,_Irvine,_California">the faculty housing complex I live in</a>. We held a neighborhood party to celebrate; probably if you&#x27;re not a resident of the neighborhood you&#x27;re not interested, but <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/uhgrads/index.html">here is a big pile of photos from it</a>.
