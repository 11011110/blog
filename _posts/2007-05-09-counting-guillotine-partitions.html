Someone here was asking me a few days ago what was known about counting the number of different ways to recursively partition space by axis-aligned hyperplanes. Unfortunately I don&#x27;t remember who it was, now that I&#x27;ve run across what looks like a very relevant looking reference: <a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1142725.1142734">The number of guillotine partitions in d dimensions</a>, Eyal Ackerman, Gill Barequet, Ron Y. Pinter, and Dan Romik, Inf. Proc. Lett. 98 (4): 162â€“167, 2006, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ipl.2006.01.011">doi:10.1016/j.ipl.2006.01.011</a>. So in hopes of either that person running across this post, or being able to look it up here in case they ask me again, here it is.
