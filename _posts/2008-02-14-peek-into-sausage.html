The feedback from <a href="http://11011110.livejournal.com/131944.html">the SoCG rejections</a> was actually quite detailed and helpful, much better than I&#x27;ve been used to seeing from theory conferences. And I&#x27;ve been on too many program committees myself (past and future) to resent it when some committee members say something about a paper that, taken out of context, seems nonsensical. But here&#x27;s my unhelpful summary of what they wrote anyway, just because I feel obstreperous today.
<br />

<br />
xyz Graphs: not geometric enough; graph drawing is off-topic for SoCG.
<br />

<br />
Self-overlapping curves: answers too many of the questions it opens.
<br />

<br />
Quadrilateral mesh partitioning: it could have been a good applied paper, if it had more theory, and it&#x27;s too long, but should have been longer. (Note: all my submissions fit strictly within the ten page limit.)
<br />

<br />
Road networks: would have been better to have left out the motivation.
<br />

<br />
Straight skeletons: should have submitted in the form of a 30-page journal version rather than a 10-page conference abstract.
