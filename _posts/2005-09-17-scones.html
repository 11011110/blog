Real scones were provided at the first morning tea and coffee break at Graph Drawing.  The rest of the breaks had biscuits instead, so I pined after the scones for the rest of the conference.  The plastic-wrapped rubber imitations in the dorm breakfast baskets did not satisfy, though I saw someone else bought some to bring back.  Why is it so difficult to find real scones in the US?  And why do people think those baking-powder-flavored chunks of concrete you can get at Starbucks in any way resemble scones?

Because most people in the US don&#x27;t travel enough to find real scones... or much of anything else.
