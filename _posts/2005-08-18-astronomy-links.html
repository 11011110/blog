Continuing to clear out old bookmarks: astronomy and astrophysics this time.
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://heritage.stsci.edu/gallery/gallery.html">Hubble Space Telescope image gallery</a>.  For all your astroporn needs.
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://www.solstation.com/stars.htm">Notable nearby stars</a>, and <a href="http://nstars.arc.nasa.gov/index.cfm">NASA&#x27;s nearby star database</a>.  I&#x27;d be interested in finding a link to a 3d java visualization of these stars that&#x27;s less clunky than the &quot;notable&quot; one...
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://vo.obspm.fr/exoplanetes/encyclo/encycl.html">The extrasolar planets encyclopedia</a>.  As in, planets orbiting other stars.
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://burtleburtle.net/bob/physics/orbit101.html">Orbits 101</a>.  Lots of fun Java simulations of simple orbits, stable solar systems, and systems that appear stable for a while until they become disasterously unstable.
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/sedna/">Sedna</a>, <a href="http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~chad/quaoar/">Quaoar</a>, and other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Neptunian_object">trans-Neptunian objects</a>.  We&#x27;re only just discovering that there&#x27;s a lot of stuff out there.
