The <a href="http://www.dsi.unive.it/~fun2012/accepted.php">list of accepted papers</a> for the <a href="http://www.dsi.unive.it/~fun2012/">Sixth International Conference on Fun with Algorithms</a> (to be held next June in Venice) just came out.
<br />

<br />
I have one in there; I&#x27;ll post more about it once I&#x27;ve had time to revise and upload a preprint.
