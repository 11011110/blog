<p>The <a href="http://www.dsi.unive.it/~fun2012/accepted.php">list of accepted papers</a> for the <a href="http://www.dsi.unive.it/~fun2012/">Sixth International Conference on Fun with Algorithms</a> (to be held next June in Venice) just came out.</p>

<p>I have one in there; I'll post more about it once I've had time to revise and upload a preprint.</p>
