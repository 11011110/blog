Street art? In Irvine? Apparently, now, the answer is yes. Local clothing manufacturer <a href="http://www.tillys.com/">Tillys</a> somehow <a href="http://www.ocregister.com/articles/ziegler-670632-wall-work.html">persuaded the planning commission</a> to allow them to commission <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zio_Ziegler">Zio Ziegler</a> (new Wikipedia article) to decorate one of their warehouses, right next to interstate 405, where approximately 240,000 daily drivers will see it.

You can&#x27;t exactly stop on the freeway to take photos, but I found enough other more accessible vantage points to get a few shots:
