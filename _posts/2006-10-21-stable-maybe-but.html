<p>Anyone who's taught it in an algorithms class has used (or maybe intentionally avoided) sexual analogies to describe the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_marriage_problem">stable marriage problem</a> and then gone on to say that it's actually used for matching medical students to jobs.</p>

<p>Only now someone's reified those analogies with an <a href="http://matchdust.com/help.php">internet dating service facebook extension</a>. At least, I think stable matching is the most likely interpretation of their more technical description, "some fancy magic to ensure that everyone gets the best date possible".</p>
