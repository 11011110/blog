It&#x27;s been almost a month since I took them, but I finally found time to finish off processing my photos from London. <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/london/">Gallery online here</a>. Unlike the other places we visited, I didn&#x27;t split it into many smaller folders, because the photos were too varied. Subjects included the London Eye, South Bank skater park, Tate Modern, British Museum, Greenwich Observatory, British Library, and the markets on Portobello Road.
