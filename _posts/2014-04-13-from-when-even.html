Every year about this time, my campus holds a spring celebration, with all the student organizations setting up pavilions in the park to sell food and advertise for new members, with the creative anachronists bashing each other with padded swords, and with a car show. Why a car show? I don&#x27;t know, but I always enjoy seeing the variety of shapes and colors compared to today&#x27;s mostly-the-same boxes. My favorite this year was a 1950 Chevy Fleetline, found rusting in a swamp in Tenessee; after a lot of work restoring it, its owner decided to cover it in clear-coat, showing off the patina on its metal, rather than just painting it. And then drove it cross country, towing a trailer full of his stuff, to UCI where his girlfriend is a grad student.
