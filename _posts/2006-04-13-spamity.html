<p>I'd been wondering why I hadn't been seeing any livejournal email comment notifications lately...turns out they'd been flagged as spam and trashed. Time to go hack .procmailrc again...</p>

<p>So is this an attempt at an ironic joke, spam in a message about spam, or is it a real spammer displaying his incompetence, I wonder?</p>

<p>Normally I'd delete these things but I think I'll leave this one here for the amusement value.</p>
