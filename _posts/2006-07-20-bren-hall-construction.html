Last week I did an interview for a student here who was doing a project about digital photography. So, when it came time to go home for the day, I had my camera with me, with only the 50mm lens since I didn&#x27;t want to haul all the other gear around me, and the sunset light was beautifying everything the way it does. I spent a little time photographing the construction of the new computer science building (Bren Hall) and another nearby building that turns out to have been designed by Frank Gehry.  <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/uci3/">Photo gallery here</a>.
