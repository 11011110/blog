Some good news for government transparency: <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-adv-map-ruling-20130709,0,7721742.story">The California Supreme Court has ruled that government GIS database files are public records</a> and must be released as such. My county&#x27;s tax assessor had been arguing that their database of land ownership in Orange County was software, not a public record, and wanted to charge $375,000 to license it. Now they&#x27;ll have to charge only what it costs them to duplicate the data.
