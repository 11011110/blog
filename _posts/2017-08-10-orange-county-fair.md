I don't feel like I've been taking and posting enough photos lately, so here are a couple of cell-phone snapshots from the Orange County Fair.

Supposedly, it's among the [ten largest fairs in North America](http://www.ocregister.com/2016/07/15/as-the-oc-fair-opens-we-look-at-north-americas-biggest-fairs/), and this weekend is the last chance to see it until next summer.
