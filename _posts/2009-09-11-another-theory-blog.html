To go along with her newly minted assistant professorship at Oregon State University, <a href="http://www.glencora.org/">Cora Borradaile</a> has started a new blog, <a href="http://www.glencora.org/category/silent-glen-speaks/">Silent Glen Speaks</a>. So far there&#x27;s only an introductory post (and, on the RSS feed, some abstracts of older papers) but I&#x27;ll be watching for more. Welcome to the blogosphere, Cora!
