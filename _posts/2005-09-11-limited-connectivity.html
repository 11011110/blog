I&#x27;ve arrived in Limerick, the third time in the last five years that I&#x27;ve been flying internationally over Sept. 11.  The dorms here in the University of Limerick have internet access, but for &quot;network security reasons&quot; (Mike and I think this means, to prevent file sharing) it is limited only to web browsers, through a proxy.  Which means I can&#x27;t access my usual email, nor can I upload anything to my web site, but I can access my blog.
<br />

<br />
ETA2: It turns out that socks protocol is also provided through a different proxy, and Michael Wybrow found <a href="http://zippo.taiyo.co.jp/~gotoh/ssh/connect.html">http://zippo.taiyo.co.jp/~gotoh/ssh/connect.html</a>, which provides working instructions for setting up ssh to use the proxy.  So now I have ssh, scp, cvs, etc.  Still no VPN or IMAP, but much improved!

There is an encapsulation method by which one can tunnel everything through http, though it requires a bit of work to make happen.  I wonder how difficult it would be to write a network driver for OSX which would do this encapsulation automatically...

Too much work for me to do and go to a conference at the same time, in less than a week, after probably 20 years since I last wrote any driver-level networking code.  Though if, <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/chouyu_31/203123.html?thread=487283">as you said in your other thread</a>, it were only a matter of 15 lines of Python...
