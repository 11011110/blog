* [Pentagon tiler Marjorie Rice dies](https://www.quantamagazine.org/marjorie-rices-secret-pentagons-20170711/) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/Knymr1MZTfb)). Sadly, she wasn't able to find out about Rao's new solution to the pentagon tiling problem.

* [Female CS pioneers](https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/questions/2547/advances-in-cs-appropriate-for-cs1-and-cs2-made-by-female-computer-scientists), described at a level suitable for freshman computer scientists ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/W9KkUvqNcWM)).

* [Images that trick automated image classifiers](https://blog.openai.com/robust-adversarial-inputs/), even when transformed ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/XrcRmTR2XzQ), via [BB](http://boingboing.net/2017/07/18/tabby-cat-vs-desktop-computer.html)). Generated by hill-climbing with an evaluation function that tests the misclassification rate of an array of transformed classifiers.

* [Fair Open Access principles](https://alexholcombe.wordpress.com/2017/07/17/the-fair-open-access-principles/) for open-access journals: transparent ownership, author retains copyright, explicit open licensing, publication not conditional on fees or membership, and fees are low and transparent ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/5o7GqCyt1P7)). They mostly look reasonable, but the ownership requirement may create a problematic barrier to entry.

* [Brilliant geometry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOVzytir7bM), Matt Parker's video of Henry Segerman's exhibit ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/81KJ2jWXy96)). What stereographic projection from the fourth dimension means, and how it gives us a distorted picture of four-dimensional shapes.ï»¿

* [How the design trend towards gray-on-gray text is making web pages harder to read](https://www.wired.com/2016/10/how-the-web-became-unreadable/) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/TWk9i9mAgux)). Also text-editing apps. If you want to avoid this problem, use [an online tool for checking that your color combination has enough contrast](https://snook.ca/technical/colour_contrast/colour.html).

* [Why you shouldn't worry when your Google Scholar h-index drops a little sometimes instead of staying monotonic](https://quantixed.wordpress.com/2017/07/18/rollercoaster-ups-and-downs-of-google-scholar-citations/) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/dqRUzSM87zy)).

* [Geometry of a triple bubble](http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_694641), one of [Crockett Johnson's mathematically inspired paintings](http://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/object-groups/mathematical-paintings-of-crockett-johnson) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/VdCPj5AdU3e), via [MF](http://www.metafilter.com/168350/Mathematical-Paintings-of-Crockett-Johnson)).

* [The travel ban: affected mathematicians tell their stories](http://www.ams.org/publications/journals/notices/201707/rnoti-p678.pdf) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/Px1ydckFcCq)). From the latest _[Notices of the American Mathematical Society](http://www.ams.org/journals/notices/201707/)_ and including also official statements from the AMS in opposition to Trump's travel ban.

* [Balanced ternary in 1544](https://archive.org/stream/bub_gb_ywkW9hDd7IIC#page/n85/mode/2up) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/RdSUTtDKg9y)). From Michael Stifel's _Arithmetica Integra_, via [Jeff Erickson on mathstodon](https://mathstodon.xyz/@jeffgerickson/157316).

* [Hinged polyomino dissection vacuum cleaner video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7N7eUcbw4k) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/Q1Rmq98SCde)). I'm not sure how this is better than completely separated subunits, but it's fun to see [something I worked on](https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9907018) turn into something more practical.

* [Fast complex-number arithmetic](https://medium.com/@smcallis_71148/complex-arithmetic-is-complicated-873ec0c69fc5) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/gEReY53BNW7)), and how the choice of compiler optimization flags can make a big difference in speed.
