For the end of year first grade vocal performance, a week ago, on Flag Day, my son&#x27;s school did a medley of patriotic songs. <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/flagday">Photos here</a>, probably not of great interest unless you&#x27;re related to one of the performers. I thought I had an excuse lined up until my dentist rescheduled, but actually it wasn&#x27;t as bad as I expected; I can&#x27;t really complain about Woodie Guthrie and Schoolhouse Rock. But is it wrong to admit that I sort of miss the ones they did when my daughter was that age, organized around &quot;It&#x27;s a Small World&quot;?
