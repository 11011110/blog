<p>I just finished uploading five new sets of photos:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/trinity/index.html">Mathematical sculpture at Trinity College Dublin</a>. Or sort-of mathematical: the artist may have intended one of these sculptures to model DNA, but to a topologist it looks like a torus link. Apparently every year the Hamilton Workshop on Geometry and Topology uses one of these as a logo, but they're running out: soon they'll have to go with the kitschy sculpture of a buxom Molly Malone outside the college gate.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/dublin/index.html">Dublin</a>. Or the parts of it that I saw outside of Trinity and Guinness. With my usual complement of graffiti.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/guinness/index.html">The Guinness Storehouse</a>. Supposedly Ireland's biggest tourist attraction. I didn't take many photos inside, although I found the tour quite interesting; most of the photos are of the 360-degree view of the Guinness brewery that one gets from the bar at the top of the tour.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/chicago/index.html">Chicago</a>. The weather was not really conducive to photography but I took a couple of shots anyway.</p></li>

<li><p><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/gd09/index.html">Graph Drawing 2009</a>. If you didn't go, now's your chance to see what you missed. If you did go, you can see how many photos you and your friends are in. I hope none of the ones I kept are too embarrassing or unflattering. <b>ETA:</b> The <a href="http://facweb.cs.depaul.edu/gd2009/gd2009.asp">GD09</a> web site now also links to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pkjha/sets/72157622359854899/detail/">another set of photos</a> by <a href="http://web.stcloudstate.edu/pkjha/home.html">Pranava Jha</a>.</p></li></ul>

The <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/dublin/HapennyBridge.html">bridge</a> is 5--10 minutes from my place.

According to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnaldo_Pomodoro">Wikipedia article on the artist</a>, they are also at the Vatican, Washington D.C., New York, Tehran, and San Francisco.
