I just finished uploading five new sets of photos:<ul>
<br />
<li><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/trinity/index.html">Mathematical sculpture at Trinity College Dublin</a>. Or sort-of mathematical: the artist may have intended one of these sculptures to model DNA, but to a topologist it looks like a torus link. Apparently every year the Hamilton Workshop on Geometry and Topology uses one of these as a logo, but they&#x27;re running out: soon they&#x27;ll have to go with the kitschy sculpture of a buxom Molly Malone outside the college gate.</li>
<br />
<li><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/dublin/index.html">Dublin</a>. Or the parts of it that I saw outside of Trinity and Guinness. With my usual complement of graffiti.</li>
<br />
<li><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/guinness/index.html">The Guinness Storehouse</a>. Supposedly Ireland&#x27;s biggest tourist attraction. I didn&#x27;t take many photos inside, although I found the tour quite interesting; most of the photos are of the 360-degree view of the Guinness brewery that one gets from the bar at the top of the tour.</li>
<br />
<li><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/chicago/index.html">Chicago</a>. The weather was not really conducive to photography but I took a couple of shots anyway.</li>
<br />
<li><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/gd09/index.html">Graph Drawing 2009</a>. If you didn&#x27;t go, now&#x27;s your chance to see what you missed. If you did go, you can see how many photos you and your friends are in. I hope none of the ones I kept are too embarrassing or unflattering. <b>ETA:</b> The <a href="http://facweb.cs.depaul.edu/gd2009/gd2009.asp">GD09</a> web site now also links to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pkjha/sets/72157622359854899/detail/">another set of photos</a> by <a href="http://web.stcloudstate.edu/pkjha/home.html">Pranava Jha</a>.</li></ul>

The <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/trinity/BerkeleyLibrary.html">sphere</a> apparently has a sister in Italy. (The sister of my wife saw it and I can ask which city if you want.) Makes me wonder if there are more around the globe.
The <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/dublin/HapennyBridge.html">bridge</a> is 5--10 minutes from my place.

Someone at the conference told me there&#x27;s also another sphere like that in Berkeley. According to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnaldo_Pomodoro">Wikipedia article on the artist</a>, they are also at the Vatican, Washington D.C., New York, Tehran, and San Francisco.

Also, I believe quite a few people here (http://cliquecluster.org/, &quot;here&quot;=&quot;my building&quot;) would have liked to chat with you.

Sorry to have missed you, then. I&#x27;ll have to find some excuse to come back to Dublin sometime, I guess. It was a pleasant place to visit.

Thanks for sharing! The Dublin graffiti photos are fantastic. And it is always a pleasure to see good photos from conferences :-)
