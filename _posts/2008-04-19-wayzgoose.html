Been a long time since I posted any photos here, hasn&#x27;t it? <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/wayzgoose08/">Here&#x27;s a few more</a> from today&#x27;s Celebrate UCI / Wayzgoose / Earth Day festival. As usual, there were plenty of ethnic food booths, battling SCAdians, classic cars, kiddie rides, and music and dance performances â€” a pleasant way to spend an afternoon.
