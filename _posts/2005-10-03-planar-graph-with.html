<p>I think most planar graphs, in some sense, should have complements with no <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.CG/0212046">confluent drawing</a>, but it's been difficult to prove.  Finally, I think I've found an example: the gyroelongated square dipyramid, shown below in two drawings. The left is a rough sketch of its form as a polyhedron with equilateral-triangle faces, while the right is a planar drawing.</p>

<p>The proof that its complement is nonconfluent resembles that for the hypercube in <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.CG/0212046">our original paper on confluence</a>.
The eight degree-five vertices of the graph form a square antiprism, whose complement is a MÃ¶bius ladder with four rungs.
This ladder has 4-cycles but no \( K_{2,3} \) subgraph, so (as we argued for the cube in our paper) the only possible drawings are formed by replacing some of its 4-cycles by confluent tracks.
We must make an odd number of replacements in order to have a planar drawing, so essentially there are only two drawings: one with a single confluent track and one with three confluent tracks.</p>

<p>The remaining two vertices of the complement must connect to each other and to a certain subset of four vertices of the ladder, and in neither case is it possible to add tracks to the drawing that make those connections.</p>

<p>The regular icosahedron (aka gyroelongated pentagonal dipyramid) should make an even more symmetric example of a planar graph with nonconfluent complement, but I don't know how to prove nonconfluence in this case.</p>
