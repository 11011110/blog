I just came back from Urbana, where I was visiting for <a href="https://plus.google.com/111327064904383598474/posts/4xMq1DM3JKs">Kyle Fox&#x27;s thesis proposal</a>. While there, I also took <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/urbana/">a few photos of the local architecture</a>.

<a href="http://valis.cs.uiuc.edu/~sariel/pictures/people/12/12/12/all/">These two photos of Sariel Har-Peled and Jeff Erickson</a> are also by me; I took them while playing with Sariel&#x27;s new camera, which has interchangeable lenses and a big back screen but no mirror or viewfinder. It seems to have a lot of the advantages of a DSLR (for instance, being able to attach really wide angle lenses) in a much more compact format, as long as you don&#x27;t mind holding it zombie-style.
