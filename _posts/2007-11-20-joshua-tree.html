We went camping in Joshua Tree again over the Veteran&#x27;s Day holiday weekend with five other families. The usual rock climbing and astronomy ensued, along with a ranger-guided tour of Keys Ranch, a homestead and former gold mine in the central part of the park. Comet Holmes was clearly visible the first night, but it clouded up on the second, giving us a beautiful sunset instead. <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/josh8/index.html">Photos here</a>.
