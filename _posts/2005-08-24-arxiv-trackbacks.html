Good news from <a href="http://www.arsmathematica.net/archives/2005/08/24/arxiv-trackbacks/">ars mathematica</a>: <a href="http://arxiv.org/help/trackback/">arxiv now supports trackbacks</a>, with the aid of which one can make links from blog entries bidirectional.  Bad news, though, <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/support/faqbrowse.bml?faqid=188">livejournal doesn&#x27;t support them</a>, and more bad news, <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/pronet/docs/trackback_spec">the trackback protocol</a> doesn&#x27;t look like something that could be easily faked up just by coding one&#x27;s URLs differently and allowing referrer autodiscovery to do its magic, or anything like that.  But good news, <a href="http://kalsey.com/tools/trackback/">there are third party tools to handle the trackback protocol for you</a>.  Maybe I&#x27;ll try using one of these tools to trackback my entries here to the papers they refer to, and see how it works...but this looks cumbersome enough that I&#x27;m not going to bother to do it every time I link to someone else&#x27;s blog postings.
