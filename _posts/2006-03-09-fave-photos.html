Today&#x27;s new Flickr feature for me to explore: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/11011110/favorites/">favorites</a>. I went through the list of all photos I&#x27;d commented on and picked out a dozen that I found really striking. There are some good photos and photographers on that site... I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m finding a small fraction of the good stuff, as I regularly view photos from few people and groups. But there&#x27;s only so much time in a day.
