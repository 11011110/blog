<p>The six vertices of a triangular prism, three midpoints of square faces of the prism, six planes through a vertex and the opposite prism edge, and three planes through the square prism faces, that I used last night to construct a <a href="{{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2006-10-15-coordinates-for-associahedra %}">symmetric representation of the associahedron</a>, also form a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_configuration">projective configuration</a>: there are nine points, each on five planes, and nine planes, each containing five points, so its Hilbert symbol is \( (9_5 9_5) \). I wonder whether it has a name.</p>
