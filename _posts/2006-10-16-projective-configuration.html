The six vertices of a triangular prism, three midpoints of square faces of the prism, six planes through a vertex and the opposite prism edge, and three planes through the square prism faces, that I used last night to construct a <a href="http://11011110.livejournal.com/76476.html">symmetric representation of the associahedron</a>, also form a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_configuration">projective configuration</a>: there are nine points, each on five planes, and nine planes, each containing five points, so its Hilbert symbol is (9<sub>5</sub>9<sub>5</sub>). I wonder whether it has a name.
