Tim Bray observes that Google searches are becoming worse as a comprehensive index to the web; there's lots of old stuff that they used to find but have forgotten.

* [How Duolingo achieved a 50:50 gender ratio for new software engineer hires](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-duolingo-achieved-5050-gender-ratio-new-software-engineer-sohn/) ([G+](https://web.archive.org/web/20190210074141/https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/N59QzMYmUQ8)).

It's a messy legal case in which a journal is accused of corrupt reviewing and is suing for slander, but it raises issues of how safe we are as reviewers in the supposed confidentiality of our identities.

* [The 2018 Mathematical Art Exhibition Awards at the Joint Mathematics Meetings](http://www.ams.org/news?news_id=4011).

* [Pier Review](https://twitter.com/DrJessicaLanger/status/952231957517295616) ([via](http://retractionwatch.com/2018/01/20/weekend-reads-scientists-respond-badly-criticism-hidden-retractions-journal-cancels-issue/)). Jessica Langer found the best newspaper pun.

Günter Ziegler makes an appearance on numberphile, with a nice discussion of [equal-area equal-perimeter convex partitions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1202.5504). There are no cannons or sparrows; the title refers to using heavy machinery to solve simple-looking problems.

* [Writing women in mathematics into Wikipedia](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.11103) ([G+](https://web.archive.org/web/20190210073846/https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/8K944L4YPSP)).

Now a Good Article on Wikipedia, thanks to the efforts of Katolophyromai. But see [Clement et al., "Re-righting the History of Women in Science", _Math Horizons_ 2009](https://www.jstor.org/stable/25678817) for a critique of the male-gaziness of some of our sources.

* [Perceived gender bias in a discipline strongly affects women's choices of what to study](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/01/25/study-finds-given-disciplines-perceived-gender-bias-not-math-biggest-predictor) ([G+](https://web.archive.org/web/20190210073712/https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/YhgabmRhMZk)).

* [How fast can you bit-interleave 32-bit integers?](https://lemire.me/blog/2018/01/09/how-fast-can-you-bit-interleave-32-bit-integers-simd-edition/). Daniel Lemire shows that special Intel-only instructions can be beaten by careful SIMD coding.

* [Trouble with Wikidata](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/12/08/wikidata_special_report/) ([G+](https://web.archive.org/web/20190210073620/https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/GKSj1U84n78)). Its inter-language links are useful, but its proponents refuse to institute reliable sourcing requirements that are compatible with Wikipedia's and have been pushing to force their data to be shown automatically as part of Wikipedia articles despite their poor sourcing, while the spammers close in.

* [More secrets of the associahedra](https://web.archive.org/web/20180519000918/https://plus.google.com/+johncbaez999/posts/A8sQSPmETHk). A neat connection between the face counts of different types in an associahedron and the coefficients of inverse power series, with an illustration that appears to be redrawn from [an old one of mine]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2006-10-13-another-gratuitously-nonplanar-drawing %}).

* [Porous marble boulders sculpted by Sibylle Pasche](http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2018/01/porous-boulder-like-sculptures-chiseled-from-italian-marble-by-sibylle-pasche/) ([via](https://web.archive.org/web/20190210073514/https://plus.google.com/+Colossal/posts/XvRCSRm8JvK)).

* [Scottish solids again](https://plus.google.com/+DavidRoberts/posts/MacU2MwWqXt). The latest piece on [polyhedral unfolding in the _Notices_](http://bit.ly/2Eeci1w) and its [corresponding G+ post](https://plus.google.com/+AmsOrg/posts/FFaFD8LQ7Ld) repeat a myth, [debunked by Lloyd in 2012](https://doi.org/10.1080/17498430.2012.670845), that the neolithic Scots carved Platonic solids out of stone. David Roberts sets the record straight.
