While at CCCG this week, I took time out to wander over to Machray Hall on the University of Manitoba campus, where <a href="http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~gunderso/">David Gunderson</a> (the chair of the mathematics department at Manitoba) has created a beautiful set of wooden mathematical models. Fortunately, I had my camera with me, so I took <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/gunderson/">a few photos</a>.

For more (including some models that weren&#x27;t on display at the time) see <a href="http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~gunderso/pages/other_pages/mathematical_models.htm">Gunderson&#x27;s web site</a>.
