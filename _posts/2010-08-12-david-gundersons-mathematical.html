<p>While at CCCG this week, I took time out to wander over to Machray Hall on the University of Manitoba campus, where <a href="http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~gunderso/">David Gunderson</a> (the chair of the mathematics department at Manitoba) has created a beautiful set of wooden mathematical models. Fortunately, I had my camera with me, so I took <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/gunderson/">a few photos</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/gunderson/DisplayHall.html"><img src="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/gunderson/DisplayHall-m.jpg" alt="Display hall of David Gunderson's mathematical models" style="border-style:solid;border-color:black;" /></a></p>

<p>For more (including some models that weren't on display at the time) see <a href="http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~gunderso/pages/other_pages/mathematical_models.htm">Gunderson's web site</a>.</p>
