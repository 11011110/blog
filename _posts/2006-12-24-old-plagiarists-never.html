<a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2153313/">19th-century plagiarists exposed by modern technology</a>. And a more recent mathematical biographer&#x27;s outraged response to the discovery of his own plagiarism. <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/57248">Via mefi</a>.

On the subject of mathematical plagiarism, I was intrigued to run across two more such stories on Wikipedia recently: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C4%83nu%C5%A3_Marcu">Dănuţ Marcu</a>, repeated and unapologetic copier of whole articles. And, in contrast, a sideline to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold_Destiny">Poincaré conjecture credit controversy</a> concerning two authors who lifted a single lemma from two other authors&#x27; online manuscript, and promptly apologized.
