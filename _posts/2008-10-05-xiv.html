It&#x27;s a little scary how quickly ones&#x27; kids grow up. My daughter Sara just turned 14. I&#x27;ve been taking the same photos of her for half her life now:

The bottom right image is from a <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/s14bd/index.html">small gathering Sara had yesterday</a> (too informal to call a birthday party any more), after which I took her and two of her friends to see <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/nick_and_norahs_infinite_playlist/">Nick and Norah&#x27;s Infinite Playlist</a>, which just opened.
<br />

<br />
Despite a few awkward transitions near the end, I enjoyed the movie a lot, and thought it was quite sweet. It follows the standard romantic-comedy plotline, but it does it well. Norah is refreshingly un-glamorous, Nick is refreshingly un-macho, and there&#x27;s plenty of believable chemistry between them from their first cute meetup. I also liked the way it&#x27;s treated as unexceptional that all of Nick&#x27;s close friends are gay. My favorite moment was near the middle, when one of those friends tells Nick the secret to life (and the Beatles&#x27; success): “I want to hold your hand,” making a personal connection, looking for love rather than sex, and then demonstrates the point by holding Nick&#x27;s hand. The strong friendship between Norah and her drunk friend Caroline works well as a side theme and motivating force throughout the movie, too, even though Caroline&#x27;s part was mostly played for comic relief. And the indie soundtrack plays right into my tastes. Overall I&#x27;d grade it a B: it&#x27;s not going to be a contender for best movie of the year, but worth seeing in the theaters. Judging from their reactions, my daughter and her friends would rate it even higher.
