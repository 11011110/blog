* [Lower bounds for adaptive relaxation-based algorithms for single-source shortest paths](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06546) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/113467642343798157)),</span> by Sunny Atalig, Alexander Hickerson, Arrdya Srivastav, Tingting Zheng, and Marek Chrobak, to appear at ISAAC 2024. This is part of a line of work including [a paper of mine at WADS 2023]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2023-05-17-permutation-supersequences-shortest %}) where I proved that, among shortest-path algorithms that perform relaxation steps in a fixed order, depending on the graph but not on the results of previous steps, Bellman–Ford is within a constant factor of the optimal number of steps. In [arXiv:2402.10343](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10343), Jialu Hu and László Kozma eliminated the constant factor for deterministic algorithms on complete graphs, as a result showing that an older paper of mine, on [a randomized version of Bellman–Ford]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2011-04-11-randomized-bellmanford %}), is strictly better than deterministic for this case. The new paper extends these results in a different direction, to algorithms whose order of operations depends (in a restricted way) on the results of previous operations, as you would want to do in any practical implementation of Bellman–Ford. For instance, once an edge has been relaxed, there's no point in doing it again until some other step has caused the distance to its starting vertex to improve.
