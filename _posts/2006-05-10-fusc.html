<p><a href="http://bit-player.org/2006/the-oddest-numbers">The oddest numbers</a>. Brian Hayes riffs on a number-theoretic recurrence that was old when Dijkstra studied it.</p>

<p>Other recent entries include <a href="http://bit-player.org/2006/summing-up">Hayes' discovery of Python, clopen intervals, and asymptotic analysis</a>, <a href="http://bit-player.org/2006/reversing-history">reversible computing</a>, and <a href="http://bit-player.org/2006/todays-catchs">some recent papers on social networks, quasicrystals, and spinorial formulations of NP-hard problems</a>.</p>

<p>Time to add another entry to my RSS reader's subscription list...</p>

<p>Finally!  Something to feed my budding interest in mathematics that's <em>not</em> over my head!</p>

<p>I'm enjoying the blog, Professor Eppstein.  You're quite handy with a camera.</p>

<p>Have you seen my other feed here, livejournal user geometryjunk? I try to keep the level lower there.</p>

<p>I hadn't.  Thanks for the feed.  I'm becoming downright inundated with the sheer volume of excellent reading material.  Far too little of it has been math, especially since I'm entering UCI as a CS major!</p>
