* Historic (but no longer extant) Native American settlements such as [Buldam, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buldam,_California) appear to have been removed from the online gazetteer of the USGS <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/114014829481913264)).</span> Other former settlements such as [Rockport, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockport,_California) have not been erased. [A discussion on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard#US_GNIS_whitewashed?) suggests the difference may be that the native settlements did not have a precise known location.

* [_The Practice of Algebraic Curves_](https://bookstore.ams.org/view?ProductCode=GSM/250) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@monsoon0/114011650421466214)),</span> new book by David Eisenbud and Joe Harris available for free download (with account registration) from the AMS.

* [Clarivate/ProQuest stop allowing libraries to buy books under perpetual licenses](https://svpow.com/2025/02/18/burn-it-all-down/) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://sauropods.win/@mike/114026738586297644)),</span> instead demanding perpetual subscription fees for the same content.

* [Is it still legal to put European private data on US clouds?](https://fosstodon.org/@bert_hubert/114032472494922878)

* [The call for nominations for the annual Knuth Prize for outstanding contributions to the foundations of computer science is out](https://www.sigact.org/prizes/knuth.html) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/114044469058465777)).</span> This year's chair is Edith Cohen; nominations are due March 31. The prize is scheduled to be presented at STOC 2024.

* [$$\mathsf{TIME}[t]\subset\mathsf{SPACE}\bigl[\sqrt{t\log t}\bigr]$$](https://people.csail.mit.edu/rrw/time-vs-space.pdf) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mastodon.social/@rrwilliams/114044198670120256)),</span> new result by Ryan Williams to appear at STOC. It applies to multi-tape Turing machines and oblivious RAMs but not to more general RAM models.

* "[Science must step away from nationally managed infrastructure](https://doi.org/10.53053/XHFX8483)" <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mastodon.social/@brembs/114042321037806828)),</span> editorial by Dan Goodman in _The Transmitter_.

* [Geometry trammels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phsSqS_NeZM) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@minimalrho/114055308185587950)),</span> a short video on mechanical linkages to draw certain algebraic curves, showing also that their operation is a bit clunky.

* [Fractal vice meets _The Great Wave off Kanagawa_](https://mastodon.art/@flockaroo/114060264353628438).

* [Pop-up geometry art book by Sjoerd Hofstra inspired by Euclid's _Elements_](https://www.si.edu/object/elements-geometry-euclid-sjoerd-hofstra%3Asiris_sil_528343) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/114078338143483773),</span> [see also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yO18uVp3zI)). I think this must be the Sjoerd Hofstra of Hofstra Book Arts in Brooklyn, not the Dutch sociologist and anthropologist with the same name.

* [Mark-Jason Dominus tried to get LLM Claude to understand the Hadwiger numbers of cubes](https://blog.plover.com/tech/gpt/graph-theory.html) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@mjd/114078629111638469),</span> [repost](https://mathstodon.xyz/@mjd/114081907725878427)). It didn't go well.
