<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berenkuil,_Eindhoven">The Berenkuil</a>, in Eindhoven, is a traffic circle for bicycles nested inside a traffic circle for cars. It's also a place where graffiti artists are encouraged to work, without having to worry about getting arrested â€” a city ordinance makes it a free zone for graffiti. And it's only a short walk from TU/e and the city center. <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/2008/09/28/photos-from-netherlands.html">I first visited there in 2008</a>, and on my <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/2011/09/24/report-from-graph.html">recent visit for graph drawing</a> I found some time to go back there, on a day that turned out to have the best weather of the trip. <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/berenkuil/index.html">Here are the photos I took this time,</a> including a couple of some artists at work.</p>
