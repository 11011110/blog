Houdini&#x27;s most famous magical act was as an escape artist, but one of his other tricks, which some coauthors and I <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/a-hayes.html">wrote about some time ago</a>, involved origami-like constructions, in which a piece of paper was carefully folded, then cut along a single line, and unfolded to produce complex shapes. <a href="http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~edemaine/foldcut/sen_book.html">Erik Demaine has evidence that this problem dates back at least to early-18th-century Japan</a>. In our paper (and others roughly contemporaneously by different sets of authors) we showed that any polygon can be cut in this way.

Anyway, now there&#x27;s <a href="http://jorigami.sourceforge.net/">an open-source implementation called JOrigami</a>, due to a Brazilian team of programmers involving Paulo Silveira, Rafael Cosentino, Jos√© Coelho, and Deise Aoki. Their web site has lots of pretty pictures of what look like quite difficult folding patterns...
