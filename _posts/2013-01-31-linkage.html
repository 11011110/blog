<p>Some brief links:</p>

<p>Andre Schulz has a new blog, <a href="http://ongraphs.de/blog/">on graphs: a blog on geometric graphs and other things</a></p>

<p>From his first post, I learn that the <a href="http://www.ibr.cs.tu-bs.de/alg/eurocg13/program.html">list of acceptances</a> for EuroCG is available. No abstracts yet; hopefully they're coming soon.</p>

<p>For those of you using git to manage your papers, Jukka Suomela has a nice utility making color-highlighted word-level diffs work better: <a href="https://github.com/suomela/gitwdiff">https://github.com/suomela/gitwdiff</a>.  There are also some interesting <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6188780/git-latex-workflow/6190412#6190412">tips for git+latex workflow</a> on stackoverflow; I don't necessarily agree with all of them (the use of branches seems overly finicky to me) but some of them look like good ideas.</p>

<p>And (via <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/124302/How-Grandmother-Triode-Stole-Binary-from-the-Sun">MF</a>) <a href="http://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/how-grandmother-triode-stole-binary-from-the-sun">a cute modern just-so story</a>.</p>
