<p>I and my wife started a stint today as volunteer math coaches for my daughter's junior high school's Academic Pentathlon team. I competed in the Academic Decathlon in high school (we won the state, at that time the highest level, in a competition held coincidentally enough in Irvine) so this was a bit of a blast from the past for me. My feeling is that this type of competition is a lot more about test taking skills than it is about pure academic knowledge, so we've been working through some sample questions we have and after each one going over how to solve it: ways to eliminate answers quickly, what math you need to know to solve it, different types of trick questions, how to handle a question where the true answer is not one of the multiple choices given, etc. But if we want to continue in the same style I think we're going to have to do some searches for more multiple-choice quiz questions...</p>

<p>Something that's the same at the junior high school and university levels: the whiteboard markers left in the classrooms are always dry and nonfunctional.</p>
