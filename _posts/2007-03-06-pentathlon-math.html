I and my wife started a stint today as volunteer math coaches for my daughter&#x27;s junior high school&#x27;s Academic Pentathlon team. I competed in the Academic Decathlon in high school (we won the state, at that time the highest level, in a competition held coincidentally enough in Irvine) so this was a bit of a blast from the past for me. My feeling is that this type of competition is a lot more about test taking skills than it is about pure academic knowledge, so we&#x27;ve been working through some sample questions we have and after each one going over how to solve it: ways to eliminate answers quickly, what math you need to know to solve it, different types of trick questions, how to handle a question where the true answer is not one of the multiple choices given, etc. But if we want to continue in the same style I think we&#x27;re going to have to do some searches for more multiple-choice quiz questions...

Something that&#x27;s the same at the junior high school and university levels: the whiteboard markers left in the classrooms are always dry and nonfunctional.
