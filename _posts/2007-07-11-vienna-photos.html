<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/vienna/">Vienna photos now online</a>. The globe museum, a maze garden at the Sch√∂nbrunn, Hundertwasserhaus, an attempt at something artistic involving the hotel roof, and a few miscellaneous ones from downtown.
<br />

<br />
Nothing from the Albertina, the Leopold, the Belvedere, Momuk, or Kunsthalle Wien, although I spent quite a bit more time at those places than at the ones I photographed. The exterior of Momuk, especially, could be the subject of some interesting photography, though the weather didn&#x27;t cooperate when we saw it.
