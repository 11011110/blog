Tuesday and Wednesday we took the family rafting with <a href="http://www.oars.com/">O.A.R.S.</a> on the South Fork of the American River. I got a little motion-sick, Timothy got a little cold on Wednesday morning when it was more overcast, Diana and Sara got a little bug-bitten (we forgot our insect repellant, oops), and one of our guides fell out of the boat on the first easy rapid, but in general a good time was had by all.
<br />

<br />
Prior to the trip, we found a waterproof bag for one of our compact digicams to use on the water, but ended up not using it as we were too busy paddling. We ordered a CD of photos from one of the companies that waits by the bigger rapids shooting all the rafters going past, but I don&#x27;t know whether their licensing terms will allow us to put their photos online. In the meantime, <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/sfar/index.html">here are my photos from the river bank</a>, at the O.A.R.S. campsite where we stayed Monday and Tuesday nights.
