<b>aperiodic1</b>: Lindley&#x27;s Theorem<br />
<b>2009-03-04T04:16:48Z</b><br />
Greetings,

I read your entry in Wikipedia regarding Lindley&#x27;s Theorem while searching for something else.  Nice article.  There were, however, no references given, and I wonder which Lindley you are referring to since I haven&#x27;t been able to find the name elsewhere.  Please advise.

Thank you and regards,

aperiodic1

You mean the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindley_equation">Lindley equation</a> article? I merely did a small housekeeping edit on it, nothing substantial. But I assume it&#x27;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Lindley">Dennis V. Lindley</a>, an important early queueing theorist who is also responsible for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindley's_paradox">Lindley&#x27;s paradox</a>.

Yes, Lindley&#x27;s equation, although half the links I checked referred to it as a theorem.  I knew an American lady mathematician named Lindley who lived in Mexico forty years ago or so and who told me she had done some theoretical work but I can&#x27;t remember what area of mathematics it was.  Anyway, it&#x27;s not the same Lindley.  Thanks.
