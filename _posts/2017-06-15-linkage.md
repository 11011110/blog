* [Zuse describes breadth-first search in 1945](http://zuse.zib.de/item/gHI1cNsUuQweHB6) (pp. 96–105 of link; [G+](https://web.archive.org/web/20190217230216/https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/3zETVZzQ7nV)) as [noticed by Jeff Erickson](https://web.archive.org/web/20190217230247/https://plus.google.com/+JeffErickson/posts/BoLhLRp7qYt). This is already 14 years earlier than the textbook date for the discovery of BFS, but Jeff thinks earlier instances are out there.

* [The Poincaré Homology Sphere](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/roots-of-unity/a-few-of-my-favorite-spaces-the-poincare-homology-sphere/). Evelyn Lamb explains what this space is and why it's interesting.

* [Less is more](http://crookedtimber.org/2017/05/28/less-is-more/) ([G+](https://web.archive.org/web/20190217230121/https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/jgb3Yu7kuUM)). This Crooked Timber post and its discussion raise an interesting philosophical question about academic productivity: Is it better to have a small number of publications, but only in top venues, or to have the same amount of top-venue productivity plus a lot of lower-level publications?

* [Dot grid paper for writing mathematics](https://nickhigham.wordpress.com/2017/05/08/dot-grid-paper-for-writing-mathematics/) ([G+](https://web.archive.org/web/20190217230007/https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/fPNC32XprVX)). I'm thinking of switching from my habitual squared Moleskines to something nicer.

* [Squared squares](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoRjwZomUK0) video from Numberphile ([G+](https://web.archive.org/web/20190217225924/https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/jFuu8Hb3KNu)). The recreational math problem that began Bill Tutte's work in graph theory.

* [Self-similar polygonal tilings](https://web.archive.org/web/20190217225845/https://plus.google.com/101584889282878921052/posts/YdstbQVhAcq). Richard Green shares an image by Michael Barnsley and Andrew Vince of a quasiperiodic tiling with two similar prototiles, such that the whole tiling is similar to a subdivided copy of itself.

* [Lance Fortnow's annual listing of which theoreticians are moving where](http://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2017/06/theory-jobs-2016.html), including the news that Vijay Vazirani is coming to UC Irvine! [Here's a related reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/6go8x2/farewell_to_one_of_techs_best_professors/) by a former student, calling Vijay "an amazing professor", one of the best at his former institution.

* [UC Irvine recognized as a Hispanic Serving Institution](http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-uc-irvine-latino-20170609-story.html). We're better known for our even-bigger Asian population, but a quarter of our students are Hispanic/Latinx, and we're one of only three top-100 research universities in the US to be distinguished in this way.

* [Does pigeonhole degrade gracefully?](https://theorydish.blog/2017/05/30/does-pigeonhole-degrade-gracefully/) A new Stanford theory blog discusses a sharp phase change in the maximum number of almost-disjoint sets of a given size, as the size drops below roughly the square root of the total number of elements.

* "[A Puzzle of Clever Connections Nears a Happy End](http://buff.ly/2rFeU3O)", _Quanta_ Magazine. Andrew Suk's almost-complete solution to the happy ending problem, getting the correct exponential ($$2^n$$ not $$4^n$$) for how many points in general position in the plane are needed to guarantee the existence of a convex $$n$$-gon.

* [Lebanese civil engineering professor with a valid visa and multiple past entries to the US denied entry to present his research at a conference](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/06/12/au-beirut-professor-turned-back-us-airport). The sponsoring organization (ASCE) issued only a mealy-mouthed non-protest.

* [Joris Laarman's Bone Chair](http://www.jorislaarman.com/work/bone-chair/). An early and pioneering work of generative design, a technique that is now becoming more commonplace and popular for its organic "art nouveau" forms and minimal use of materials. See the G+ post for several more recent generative design links.

* [Ruler, compass and helix constructions](https://mathstodon.xyz/@jhertzli/59637). From a post by @jherzli on [mathstodon.xyz](https://mathstodon.xyz/), a new social media platform for mathematicians.
