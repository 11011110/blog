<b><a href="http://leonardo_m.livejournal.com/"><img src="http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif" alt="[info]" width="17" height="17" style="vertical-align: bottom; border: 0;" />leonardo_m</a></b> just posted a fine collection of <a href="http://leonardo-m.livejournal.com/13481.html">links to algorithmic art</a>. His link to <a href="http://nodebox.net/code/index.php/Gallery">nodebox</a> attracted my attention first as it is based on Python on the Mac, but the art he shows in his post from <a href="http://chriscoyne.com/gallery/view.php">chriscoyne</a> is more visually appealing to me: of the fractal L-system type, but with very good control of color, line, and tonality. I also found the image below (<a href="http://nodebox.net/code/index.php/Ariel">from nodebox, created by Tom De Smedt</a>) especially intriguing; it&#x27;s a visualization of the pattern of motion of a flock of simulated birds, but I&#x27;m not sure whether it was intended more as a visual aid for understanding that motion or as a piece of abstract art.
