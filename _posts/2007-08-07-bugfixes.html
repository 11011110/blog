<p>I've put up a new version of <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/PADS/">PADS</a> after making some bugfixes to the partial cube recognition code, which the two graphs below gave some trouble to. The left one was causing it to crash, and the right was incorrectly reported as being a partial cube; the correct behavior in both cases was to report that the graph is not a partial cube. Now fixed and added to the test cases within the code. Fortunately, both bugs involved minor implementation details rather than any issues with the algorithm itself.</p>
