* [This week the editorial board of a <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;Wiley&nbsp;&nbsp;</u> journal in <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;economics&nbsp;&nbsp;</u> resigned because of pressure from the publisher to relax editorial standards and specificity in favor of growth](https://retractionwatch.com/2024/02/12/econ-journal-board-quits-en-masse-because-wiley-appeared-to-emphasize-quantity-over-quality/) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/111934468436518323)).</span> Retraction Watch maintains a growing [list of these mass resignations](https://retractionwatch.com/the-retraction-watch-mass-resignations-list/) but I've heard unsubstantiated rumors of at least one (in a non-STEM field) that's not on their list and I suspect there are more. In the current era of demands for open access to scientific research, it seems to me that the only safeguard against profit-motivated corruption of the literature is diamond-model or low-cost open access publications from which the profit motive has been removed.
