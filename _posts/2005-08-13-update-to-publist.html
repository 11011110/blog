<p>While preparing for my next performance review, I discovered three more journal papers that had recently appeared.  Or maybe not so recently: one was in 2004.  Why don&#x27;t people tell me these things?</p>


<p>They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>D. Eppstein and J. Wang.
<a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/publications/jgaa/accepted/2004/EppsteinWang2004.8.1.pdf">Fast approximation of centrality</a>.
J. Graph Algorithms &amp; Applications 8(1):27-38, 2004.</li>
<li>E. Demaine, M. Demaine, D. Eppstein, G. Frederickson, and E. Friedman.
<a href="http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~edemaine/papers/HingedPolyforms/paper.pdf">Hinged dissections of polyominos and polyforms</a>.
Computational Geometry: Theory and Applications 31(3):237-262, 2005 (special issue for 11th CCCG).</li>
<li>D. Eppstein and T. Givargis.
Memory reference caching for activity reduction on address buses.
J. Microprocessors &amp; Microsystems 29(4):145-153, 2005.
Tony&#x27;s link to an online version of this seems to be broken,
but <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~givargis/pubs/C18.pdf">the conference version is here</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>I think this is my cue that I need to put more stuff into the other end of the journal publication pipeline.  I have a bunch of conference papers that I&#x27;ve been too lazy to journalize...</p>
