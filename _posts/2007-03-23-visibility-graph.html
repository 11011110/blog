<p>Looking through the latest Society of Illustrators Annual, I found the perfect illustration of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visibility_graph">visibility graph</a> on the cover of a New Yorker from two years ago, by Richard McGuire.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/2007/mcguire-visibility-graph.jpg" alt="Richard McGuire cover illustration for The New Yorker, February 7, 2005, showing lines of sight between people in a crowd" /></p>

<p>(I have no connection to this site, but since I stole their image instead of taking the trouble to scan it myself, I'll give them a link: <a href="http://www.cartoonbank.com/product_details.asp?sid=120457">prints available for sale here</a>.)</p>
