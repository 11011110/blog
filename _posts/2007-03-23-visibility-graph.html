Looking through the latest Society of Illustrators Annual, I found the perfect illustration of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visibility_graph">visibility graph</a> on the cover of a New Yorker from two years ago, by Richard McGuire.

(I have no connection to this site, but since I stole their image instead of taking the trouble to scan it myself, I&#x27;ll give them a link: <a href="http://www.cartoonbank.com/product_details.asp?sid=120457">prints available for sale here</a>.)
