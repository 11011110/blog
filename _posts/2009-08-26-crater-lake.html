Returning to my backlogged vacation photos: after the <a href="http://11011110.livejournal.com/177495.html">Rogue River Rafting</a>, the next block of time on my vacation was a visit to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Shakespeare_Festival">Oregon Shakespeare Festival</a> in Ashland, Oregon, where we saw <i><a href="http://www.osfashland.org/browse/production.aspx?prod=166">Don Quixote</a></i> (a new and somewhat metafictional adaptation by Octavio Solis), <i><a href="http://www.osfashland.org/browse/production.aspx?prod=167">Much Ado About Nothing</a></i> (an interesting production set in post-WWII Sicily), <i><a href="http://www.osfashland.org/browse/production.aspx?prod=164">The Servant of Two Masters</a></i> (extremely funny, the high point of the visit), and <i><a href="http://www.osfashland.org/browse/production.aspx?prod=159">Macbeth</a></i> (appropriately dark, spooky, and dramatic). But we also had two free days between rafting and the theater, which we used to see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Caves_National_Monument">Oregon Caves</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crater_Lake">Crater Lake</a>.
<br />

<br />
Anyone who&#x27;s been to the lake will know that it&#x27;s (a) gorgeous; (b) very heavily photographed; and (c) very difficult to photograph well, due both to the very wide field of view that the lake spans from any of its viewpoints and to the striking electric blue color that the water takes on due to being the deepest and purest lake in the US. Nevertheless, I couldn&#x27;t help trying again (I&#x27;d been there twenty years earlier, as part of my honeymoon, but I don&#x27;t have scans of my photos from that time.) I&#x27;m not sure that I succeeded any better than previously, despite this time having a nice DSLR and fisheye lens, but the photo gallery is <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/craterlake/">here</a>.
