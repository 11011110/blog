title:  'A confluent drawing'

In the revisions of one of my papers, I needed an illustration of the graph shown below, which comes from an NP-completeness reduction. This is a confluent drawing: two vertices are connected by an edge whenever there is a smooth path between them. (The paths are allowed to self-intersect, so for instance all 30 outer vertices form a clique.)
<br />

<br />

<br />
I think it&#x27;s a great illustration of the power of confluent graph drawing: the graph has 37 vertices, 536 edges, and an average degree of nearly 29, but despite being so dense the graph has a lot of structure and the drawing makes the structure apparent.

I guess you need for the smooth path between two adjacent vertices to not go through any other vertex?

Right.

Hello,
I&#x27;m so attractive to this graph at the first sight. It&#x27;s incredibly beautiful!
Please forgive me without knowing much about graph drawing and your previous work...and allow me to quote a question of my CS friend after showing this drawing to her:
it looks more like an artwork, what&#x27;s the practical use of this drawing?

This drawing (or rather a less symmetrically arranged and less colorful but otherwise similar drawing) was added to one of my papers, as a way to describe an NP-completeness reduction visually, after a referee complained that the text description was difficult to understand. So the use of this specific drawing is to communicate a research idea.

Thanks for your reply. 
Though the reduction might be complicated...this visualization is enjoyable :)

Reminds me of &quot;Railway Mazes&quot; invented by Roger Penrose, I believe.  He wrote a chapter on the subject in the recently published book: A lifetime of Puzzles.

These mazes are effectively confluent drawings with only &quot;Start&quot; and &quot;Exit&quot; nodes but you have to figure out how to get from one to the other smoothly.

Very pretty!

Thanks for the reference. There&#x27;s a variant of confluent drawing (which I&#x27;m not using here) in which the smooth paths are not allowed to travel along the same part of a curve twice (not even in opposite directions); it&#x27;s still possible in polynomial time to test whether two vertices are connected in such a drawing but it&#x27;s somewhat nontrivial, enough to make for an interesting puzzle. Now I&#x27;m wondering whether that&#x27;s part of the difficulty in the puzzles you refer to.

Roger Penrose&#x27;s article contains lots of nice hand-drawn mazes which he invented (as a child, as I recall).  He discusses several techniques he devised to make them harder, but I don&#x27;t remember anything about traversing curves only once.  There is some switching variation he discusses at the end.

It is too bad the book is rather expensive.  There doesn&#x27;t seem to be much (anything?) on the web on the subject.

There is also a closely related concept in topology: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Train_track">train tracks</a>.
