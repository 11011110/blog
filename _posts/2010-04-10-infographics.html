<p>Like many people, I'm a fan of infographics, but they can get a little silly. <a href="http://www.gyford.com/">Phil Guyford</a> tells us how.</p>

<blockquote><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/philgyford/4505748943/sizes/o/">“How much more interesting those infographics could have been if the creators had tried to illuminate some point other than the size of one-dimensional sets of numbers relative to each other and telling us nothing that we couldn't have discovered by seeing a couple of numbers printed in normal text rather than some overblown self-important visualization that gives the talented creators of good, eye-opening infographics a bad name: LOTS.</a>”</blockquote>

<p>Formatted as an infographic, naturally.</p>

<p>I don't entirely agree: I think we still do too much of our reasoning anecdotally (biasing us in favor of who can tell the better story rather than in favor of the better cost-benefit tradeoffs in our societal decision making) and that popularizing this kind of numerical comparison can be a good way of countering that, even if it really is only about comparing one-dimensional quantities. But still, he has a point.</p>

Excellent, thanks for that - even though I also don't entirely agree.
