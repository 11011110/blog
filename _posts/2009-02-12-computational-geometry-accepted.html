No doubt everyone else is also posting this, but, <a href="http://valis.cs.uiuc.edu/blog/?p=1903">thanks to Sariel</a>, here is the list of <a href="http://valis.cs.uiuc.edu/~sariel/misc/blog/09/02/12/socg09.txt">accepted papers</a> to the <a href="http://www.madalgo.au.dk/socg2009/">25th ACM Symposium on Computational Geometry</a>, to be held next June in Denmark.
<br />

<br />
I was quite pleased to see one of my papers, the one with Mumford, Speckmann, and Verbeek on <a href="http://11011110.livejournal.com/162842.html">area-universal cartograms</a>, on the list, and it looks like there are many other interesting titles as well.

I remembered you mentioning that you were submitting something, but not what your real name is, so I didn&#x27;t notice that the first time I scanned the list. It&#x27;s the one on persistent cohomology? Congratulations!

Yup, that&#x27;s the one. I&#x27;m the Mikael - and I&#x27;m coauthoring with Vin de Silva.
