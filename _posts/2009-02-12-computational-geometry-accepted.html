<p>No doubt everyone else is also posting this, but, <a href="http://valis.cs.uiuc.edu/blog/?p=1903">thanks to Sariel</a>, here is the list of <a href="http://valis.cs.uiuc.edu/~sariel/misc/blog/09/02/12/socg09.txt">accepted papers</a> to the <a href="http://www.madalgo.au.dk/socg2009/">25th ACM Symposium on Computational Geometry</a>, to be held next June in Denmark.</p>

<p>I was quite pleased to see one of my papers, the one with Mumford, Speckmann, and Verbeek on <a href="{{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2009-01-28-cartograms-that-can %}">area-universal cartograms</a>, on the list, and it looks like there are many other interesting titles as well.</p>

I remembered you mentioning that you were submitting something, but not what your real name is, so I didn't notice that the first time I scanned the list. It's the one on persistent cohomology? Congratulations!

Yup, that's the one. I'm the Mikael - and I'm coauthoring with Vin de Silva.
