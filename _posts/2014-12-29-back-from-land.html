<p>In the unlikely event that anyone wondered why I didn't post anything either here or over on my Google+ account for the last few days, it's because I unexpectedly found myself incommunicado, visiting relatives for Christmas. Here are two of them, my cousin's daughters.</p>

<p>It's normal for there to be no cell phone service at my parents' house in Mendocino. Cell phones finally reached downtown Mendocino a couple of years ago over the objections of some protesters who were terrified of being exposed to any form of electromagnetic radiation, but there's a hill between downtown and the house that blocks the signal. There would normally be landline phone service there, but the lines got flooded in the big storm a couple of weeks ago and AT&amp;T hasn't succeeded in drying them out yet. And my parents also have cable internet, but for some other reason that went down too. So we had to resort to old-fashioned behavior like reading books or actually interacting with each other instead of all being absorbed in our own separate electronic devices the way we otherwise would likely have been.</p>

The cable internet connection was functional during your stay. The wireless access point died and a new one will be up for your next visit.<br />

<p>I used to carry around a wireless access point of my own for situations like that, but I think I accidentally left it in a hotel (that was also having internet problems).</p>
