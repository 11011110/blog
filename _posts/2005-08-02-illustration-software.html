Ed Pegg has a <a href="http://www.maa.org/editorial/mathgames/mathgames_08_01_05.html">nice roundup of vector graphics tools</a>, including both geometric construction software and general purpose illustration applications.  I&#x27;ve been using Cinderella and Illustrator regularly for my own figures, and occasionally other software (Mathematica, povray) but often lately I&#x27;ve been writing little scripts to generate SVG directly — e.g. for my Pisa skip-quadtree talk slides, I was able to make figures of quadtrees and kd-trees algorithmically with much more detail than I would have been willing to include in a hand-drawn figure.  I then use Batik or Illustrator to convert the SVG into PDF for pdflatex.  The <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/thickness/">thickness-two 6d hypercube drawing</a> I&#x27;ve been using as one of my icons was also produced as an SVG file in this way.
<br />

<br />
My copy of Illustrator is about a version out of date, and likely due to that its SVG support is a little wonky, but it works well enough that I haven&#x27;t really felt any need to update it.  Cinderella is showing its age a little, though — its great strength is robustness of the numerics in its animations, but the UI is a little clunky, and AFAIK has never been updated for OS X, so I may check out the alternatives for that type of program that Pegg lists.
