<p>The list of accepted papers at WADS is out: go to <a href="http://wads.org/">the main WADS site</a> and click on the "accepted papers" tab at the top of the page, or follow <a href="http://134.117.54.232:8080/wads/accepted-papers">this direct link</a>.</p>

<p>I'll post about own my papers there later when I have preprint versions available to link to. The rest of the program looks fascinating; I'm looking forward to finding out what all those intriguing titles actually mean.</p>
