Via <a href="http://valis.cs.uiuc.edu/blog/index.php/archives/2006/08/03/the-story-of-lemma-56/">Sariel</a>: <a href="http://graphics.cs.uiuc.edu/svn/kcrane/web/picturebookv2.pdf">The Story of Lemma 5.6</a>. Keenan Crane attempts to convey a computational topology proof through talk slides in a children&#x27;s-picturebook style. My impression: it works very well for helping me to remember what objects all those similar Greek letters are standing for, less well at making clear what are the assumptions of the lemma and what is the consequence that&#x27;s supposed to follow from those assumptions.

Aw!  That&#x27;s cute!  Although a small chunk of the moral at the end has nothing to do with the story (where&#x27;d the 2&#x27;s come from?), I&#x27;d love to see more of these...because I&#x27;d love to teach my hypothetical offspring topology at a young, impressionable age.
