Is it wrong of me to be worried about the interaction between pdf files as a frequently-exchanged medium of academic discourse, and pdf files as <a href="http://www.2-viruses.com/article-infected-pdf-files">attack vectors</a>, especially given rumors (<a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9144844/Hackers_used_IE_zero_day_not_PDF_in_China_Google_attacks">later contradicted</a>) that pdf vulnerabilities were involved in the recent Google/China spat? It would be bad if black hats figured out a way to infect the literature that we depend on. Maybe this means I should be more consistent about using my Kindle rather than my computer to view pdf files whenever I&#x27;m unsure of their provenance.

It&#x27;s probably sufficient to just use anything other than Adobe products to read PDF files.  For extra security, run the reader on an operating system that doesn&#x27;t come from Redmond.

I do usually do both of those. I don&#x27;t imagine Apple&#x27;s preview is actually more secure than Adobe Reader, but I guess it&#x27;s much less heavily targeted by attackers.

There&#x27;s a good chance a common PDF reader is more secure than Adobe&#x27;s, since Adobe&#x27;s does much more.

It&#x27;s packed with form filling and encryption features people rarely use, all which are another attack vectors.

You could also view it using Gmail&#x27;s &quot;view&quot; feature.  That&#x27;s how I end up reading most of my pdfs nowadays.

Good point. That works well enough when it comes via gmail, which is I think most of them. Probably it wouldn&#x27;t be too hard to view anything on the web that way too.

Or in my case OS X&#x27;s Preview app, but I guess it&#x27;s the same principle.
