<p>The <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/sfar-hs/">action photos from our rafting trip</a> arrived a couple days ago: a rare chance to see shots of me doing something with my family rather than behind the lens. The photographers captured the action well, I think, though we were a little too far past them when we almost flipped the boat, so they missed that part. And getting all the shots on CD (27 in all, though I put fewer on the web site) seems much more convenient than printing a few blowups; for instance it allowed me to crop the photos to my own taste. I had forgotten how annoying it is to tweak color and exposure of jpeg instead of raw, though...</p>

<p>I'll be doing an O.A.R.S. trip on the California River in August.  It's good to know that the license for the photos allowed you to post them online.</p>

<p>Your son alternates between looking elated and terrified.  I suspect he had fun.  :-)</p>

<p>Except for part of the second morning when he got too cold, yeah, I suspect he did.</p>

<p>They had a line about "private personal use only" that worried me, until I realized that what it applied to was not the photos of us but some extra images of water, boating mishaps, etc that they also included on the disk.</p>
