The <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/sfar-hs/">action photos from our rafting trip</a> arrived a couple days ago: a rare chance to see shots of me doing something with my family rather than behind the lens. The photographers captured the action well, I think, though we were a little too far past them when we almost flipped the boat, so they missed that part. And getting all the shots on CD (27 in all, though I put fewer on the web site) seems much more convenient than printing a few blowups; for instance it allowed me to crop the photos to my own taste. I had forgotten how annoying it is to tweak color and exposure of jpeg instead of raw, though...

I&#x27;ll be doing an O.A.R.S. trip on the California River in August.  It&#x27;s good to know that the license for the photos allowed you to post them online.

Your son alternates between looking elated and terrified.  I suspect he had fun.  :-)

Except for part of the second morning when he got too cold, yeah, I suspect he did.

They had a line about &quot;private personal use only&quot; that worried me, until I realized that what it applied to was not the photos of us but some extra images of water, boating mishaps, etc that they also included on the disk.
