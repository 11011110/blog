Interesting discussion on Slashdot regarding <a href="http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/10/12/097213">the policies different university campuses have for blocking access to web content</a>. The general concensus seems to be that many universities impose bandwidth limitations but very few impose content limitations. This seems to me the right place to draw the line...
