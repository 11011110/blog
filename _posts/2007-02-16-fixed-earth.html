If you&#x27;re like me, you probably thought that <a href="http://11011110.livejournal.com/11964.html">humorous comparisons between creationist evolution-disbelievers and anti-Copernican astronomy-disbelievers</a> were just exaggerations to make plain the intellectual bankruptcy of the Intelligent Design proponents. Right? Nobody in any position of authority could seriously believe in this modern age that the earth doesn&#x27;t revolve around the sun.

<br />
Think again. <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/012504.php">State congressmen in Georgia and Texas caught peddling Fixed Earth Society crankery</a>. And it isn&#x27;t even their know-nothing attitude that&#x27;s getting them in trouble, it&#x27;s the virulent anti-Semitism that comes in the same package.

What century are we living in again?
