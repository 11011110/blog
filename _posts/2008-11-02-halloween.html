We had a quiet Halloween this year â€” many of the houses along our street leave their lights out, so the hordes of kids who live in our neighborhood tend to pass it by for more inviting ones. Timothy decided to be a ninja and went out with a friend dressed as (his mother told me) Ichigo from Bleach. Sara is getting a little old for trick-or-treating, but decided to go with a friend at the last minute, and ended up being a sparkly vampire from the Twilight series of books. <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/halloween08/index.html">Photos here</a>, a few of Timothy and more of our jack-o-lanterns.
