It&#x27;s too far for me to attend, but I just received a reminder that <a href="http://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~vazirani/BAD/">the Bay Area Discrete Math Day</a> (Bad Math for short) is coming up on the 22nd in Berkeley.  Looks like I&#x27;ll miss a <a href="http://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~vazirani/BAD/abs_2005-2006_fall/peres.html">very interesting talk by Peres on randomized versions of Hex and other combinatorial games</a>.
