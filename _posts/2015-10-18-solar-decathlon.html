<p>Two years ago, and again this year, Irvine hosted the <a href="http://www.solardecathlon.gov/">Solar Decathlon</a>, a contest in which groups of university students design and build a small, inexpensive, and self-sufficient solar house and get judged on ten categories for how good their house is. The houses (and various related vendor exhibits) were on show to the public at a public park in Irvine, with students from each team on hand to explain their designs. So yesterday I went to see them, and took a few photos.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="Solar panels on the West Virginia / Tor Vergata entry in the 2015 Solar Decathlon, Irvine, California" src="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/solardecathlon/WestVirginiaTorVergata2-m.jpg" style="border-style:solid;border-color:black;" /></p>

<p>Unfortunately I didn't keep any shots from my favorite of the houses, an effort by Clemson involving a modular open-source design made out of aluminum composite panels, with amazingly lightweight but strong and attractive snap-together wooden furniture. It was also the only one to pack three bedrooms into the 1000 square foot limit for the enclosed part of the house.</p>

<p>Instead, <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/solardecathlon/">here are some of the other houses, with annotations</a>.</p>
