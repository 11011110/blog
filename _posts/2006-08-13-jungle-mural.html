Recently my son decided he didn&#x27;t like the underwater theme of the art in his room, and wanted something more jungly, so we decided to hire our friend Katrinka Haynes to paint a jungle mural on one of the walls. It all ended up happening quickly, because she had to make time to prepare for her day job as a schoolteacher, and ended up being something of a team effort: Diana painted the background color and filled in the trees, I sponged on leaves and vines, Katrinka did the hard part of designing the mural and painting the animals (yes, we know that tree boas, jaguars, and lemurs don&#x27;t belong in the same jungles as each other), and Timothy glued some frogs and lizards onto the wall once the paint was dry.  Anyway, <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/junglemural/index.html">photos here</a>.

I also added a few more to my gallery of <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/kittens/index.html">kitten photos</a> and uploaded <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/11011110/214404562/">my favorite of the new ones</a> to Flickr.

I think those murals are fantastic.  I have done murals in the past too.  I &#x27;ve done  murals on school walls and found it very exciting and fun.  As of the moment, I plan to work on our room but my hubby seems unsure about the whole idea.
