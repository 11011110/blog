Since I suspect quite a few people would find this useful, I thought I&#x27;d publicize a list of <a href="http://networkdata.ics.uci.edu/resources.php">collections of social network and web graph datasets</a> put together as part of a social network analysis project I&#x27;m involved with. Some of the collections also include graphs from other sources such as bioinformatics, and they range in size from dozens of nodes to hundreds of millions of nodes.

very useful. I often find it hard to find meaningful large data sets that can be used to demonstrate techniques; perhaps it is easier if one is in academia.
