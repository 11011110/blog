I&#x27;m in Dagstuhl this week for a workshop on <a href="http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=13151">Drawing Graphs and Maps with Curves</a>. I gave a talk today surveying the use of curved edges in graph drawing, which may be older than you might think. For instance, did you know that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_embedding">arc diagrams</a>, named from a 2002 paper by Wattenberg in information visualization, actually go back to two papers from the 1960s on crossing minimization? <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/Dagstuhl-curves.pdf">Here are my talk slides</a>.

The power of using graph drawings is illustrated by the notion of wiring diagrams developed by Jacob Eli Goodman (
Goodman, Jacob E. (1980), &quot;Proof of a conjecture of Burr, Grünbaum, and Sloane&quot;, Discrete Math. 32: 27–35.) and exploited by him and Richard Pollack, as well as many others in studying arrangements of lines and pseuduolines.

Yes, wiring diagrams are definitely a helpful way of visualizing arrangements. (I have a graph drawing paper I&#x27;ve been working on, not yet released, that involves them, and I know of another one by some other authors that does as well). So the &quot;many others&quot; will likely continue to grow.) They&#x27;re usually drawn with polylines rather than curves, though, so they&#x27;re not really a fit for my workshop talk.
