<p>I'm in Los Angeles for Graph Drawing, went looking for good espresso near the conference site, and found it at Spring for Coffee, on the corner of 6th Street and Spring. This street art was on a different corner of the same intersection:</p>

<p>It's also the first photo-op for my new cell phone, a Samsung Note 4 that I got a month or so ago after my old faithful Droid 2 Global finally gave up. I miss having an actual physical keyboard but the big screen and up-to-date software are both big improvements.</p>
