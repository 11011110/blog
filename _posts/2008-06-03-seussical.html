This year&#x27;s junior high school musical is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seussical">Seussical</a>. In past years, they&#x27;ve allowed parents at their shows to film the kids as long as the flashes stayed off, but apparently this year the license didn&#x27;t allow even that, nor could the school videotape it themselves. But they still needed some photos of the kids in their costumes for the yearbook... So anyway I was volunteered, and came in this evening before the opening night&#x27;s show to take a few posed shots amid the pre-show chaos.
