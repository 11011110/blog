<p>This year's junior high school musical is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seussical">Seussical</a>. In past years, they've allowed parents at their shows to film the kids as long as the flashes stayed off, but apparently this year the license didn't allow even that, nor could the school videotape it themselves. But they still needed some photos of the kids in their costumes for the yearbook... So anyway I was volunteered, and came in this evening before the opening night's show to take a few posed shots amid the pre-show chaos.</p>
