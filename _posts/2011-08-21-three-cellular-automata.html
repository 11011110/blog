(1) Matthias Merzenich has found a c/7 diagonal spaceship in Conway&#x27;s Game of Life! Here it is, in <a href="http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/index.php?title=Run_Length_Encoded">RLE format</a>:<pre>x = 26, y = 26, rule = B3/S23

(2) If I&#x27;d made a list of things I intended to do this weekend, &quot;programming in C&quot; would not have been on it. But Andrew Trevorrow helpfully alerted me to the fact that my <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/ca/gfind.c">gfind software</a> (for searching for patterns such as this one, although Merzenich used a different program) didn&#x27;t work correctly when compiled in 64-bit mode, which has become the default for cc on new Apple computers, at least. In a past life long ago I used to work on a C compiler for a 36-bit architecture, so I should have known better. Anyway, I&#x27;ve updated it and I think it should work better now.
<br />

(3) The pointer to xlife on Wikipedia&#x27;s Game of Life article is woefully out of date, and I&#x27;ve been getting complaints for not letting people update it to point to their own customized versions. The trouble is, I don&#x27;t know where to find a recent and canonical version of xlife, one that everyone accepts as &quot;the standard xlife&quot;, or at least a well-curated page documenting the different versions that are available. Does anyone else have a better idea what to do with this? Or is everyone else just using <a href="http://golly.sourceforge.net/">Golly</a> these days as I am, in which case maybe Wikipedia should just drop xlife from its list.

Thank you very much for fixing gfind on such short notice!   It is chugging on my mac right now.   I wasn&#x27;t the one who originally commented on the bug, so you can know that you helped more than one person just this weekend alone.

I&#x27;m using gfind to search for spaceships in B013468/S02 -- the rule you recommended here:  http://11011110.livejournal.com/185722.html?thread=476794   Do you have a cache of pattern files  for this rule, beyond what is already available on fano, and what was shown in your growth and decay paper?       You&#x27;ve already provided CA-enthusisasts with an embarrassment of riches, but I thought it couldn&#x27;t hurt to ask!    Any RLE,etc patterns for this rule would be greatly appreciated.   

In the same spirit, I&#x27;ll post any new spaceships that gfind uncovers.

Thanks, no, <s>I haven&#x27;t tried to build a catalog of B013468/S02 patterns, so what&#x27;s in fano for that rule is pretty much all I have.</s> No wait, that&#x27;s not true, I do have some files for it. What I don&#x27;t have is a big catalog of ships, but I have some other kinds of patterns.

Thanks for publicizing this kind of interesting work in CA constructions.  I have a question.  It seems like most of the action today in Conway&#x27;s Game of Life (at least in online forums) is on the gadgets/constructions side; is there a survey of impossibility results and conjectures?

I don&#x27;t mean the known undecidability results for GOL, which follow from a rich-enough vocabulary of constructions; rather I&#x27;m curious about results ruling out certain constructions, e.g., a spaceship of a certain velocity.  Are there many interesting results of this kind?
 
As an example, Conway&#x27;s &quot;grandfather problem&quot;

http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Lifeline_Volume_6

gives an interesting kind of configuration that might be impossible.  Of course answering this kind of question is likely to be hard.

There&#x27;s the question of whether oscillating configurations with all periods are possible. <a href="http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Oscillator">Configurations are known</a> with all periods except 19, 23, 38, 41, 43, and 53. (The linked page doesn&#x27;t says so explicitly, but <a href="http://www.radicaleye.com/lifepage/patterns/bhept/bhept.html">David Buckingham showed how to construct</a> configurations with all periods â‰¥ 62.)

David, thank you very much for the extra B013468/S02 patterns -- just the sort of thing I was hoping for.    I look forward to coming up with more and sharing them here and on conwaylife.com.

Andy,   The following isn&#x27;t a survey, but I wonder if this conversation would be of interest to you:

There was a thread about xlife recently: http://www.conwaylife.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=670&amp;p=4739&amp;hilit=xlife#p4739 but it didn&#x27;t get much interest.

Maybe the version distributed with (e.g.) Debian is the canonical one?
