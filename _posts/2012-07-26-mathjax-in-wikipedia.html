<p>Some good news for viewing mathematics articles in Wikipedia: MathJax rendering is now being supported on an experimental basis. You need to have a Wikipedia login to turn it on (in the Appearance preferences) but when you do you should get nicely rendered mathematics formulas in a font size matching the article text, instead of blocky misaligned bitmap images. Actually, this has been available for a few months, but much more recently they fixed some major bugs that were causing things like less-than signs not to work, so now it's finally usable.</p>

<p>Here are three new Wikipedia articles that use mathematical formulas, and one that doesn't:</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_curve">Moment curve</a>, a polynomial curve in <i>d</i>-dimensional space useful in many lower bound constructions in discrete geometry. It's closely related to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twisted_cubic">twisted cubic</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_normal_curve">rational normal curve</a>, but I think distinct enough from them to warrant a separate article.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope_number">Slope number</a>, the minimum number of distinct edge slopes needed to draw a given graph.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wythoff_array">Wythoff array</a>, a two-dimensional permutation of the positive integers that contains every sequence defined by the Fibonacci recurrence as one of its rows.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Dugundji">James Dugundji</a> (1919â€“1985), an expert on fixed point theory. (I was indirectly led to him by a recent post by Dick Lipton on <a href="http://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2012/07/21/how-good-is-your-translator/">fixed points of natural language translation systems</a>)</p>

<p>Finally, and unrelatedly, congratulations to the new <a href="https://simonsfoundation.org/mps-funded-programs-simons-investigators">Simons Investigators</a> including several well-known theoretical computer scientists: Sanjeev Arora, Shafi Goldwasser, Russell Impagliazzo, Jon Kleinberg, and Daniel Spielman.

<p>Are you aware of the userscript for MathJax on Wikipedia written by the MathJax folks themselves?</p>

<p>I'm not sure about that one, but I've been using the one in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Nageh/mathJax">User:Nageh/mathJax</a> for some time now. But having it as a checkbox in the preferences instead of having to install magic javascripts seems like a big improvement to me.</p>
