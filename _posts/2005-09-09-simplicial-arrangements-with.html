<p>One last post on simplicial arrangements before I leave for <a href="http://www.gd2005.org/">Graph Drawing</a>, in Limerick, Ireland (my first trip to that country).</p>


<p>The drawing technique from my <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/11011110/13674.html">previous post</a> (borrowed from <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.DS/0406020">my paper on drawing partial cubes</a>) transforms any line arrangement with k slopes into a tiling of a k-gon with integer side lengths by smaller unit-side-length centrally-symmetric convex polygons.  Although the slopes of the lines may be important for realizability of the arrangement, they do not matter for the k-gon tiling, so we can assume the outer k-gon has sides that are parallel to a regular k-gon.  The requirement that the arrangement be simplicial puts additional strong constraints on this tiling: exactly three tiles must meet at each interior vertex, and the boundary vertices may either be part of a single tile or must be the meeting point of only two tiles (with some further conditions depending on whether or not the arrangement includes the line at infinity).</p>

<p>These constraints are so strong that, for small values of k, we can do the case analysis to find all simplicial arrangements with k slopes.  When k=2, we are looking for a packing of a unit-sided rectangle by squares.  In order to avoid degree four internal vertices, we can only pack a single row of squares next to each other.  When there is a single square, we must also include the line at infinity, forming a near-pencil with three lines.  When there are two or more squares, we may exclude the line at infinity (a near-pencil with one more line than squares) or include it (a near-pencil with two more lines than squares).  These rectangle tilings can be thought of as a side-on view of a prism, with the top and bottom of the prism perpendicular to the angle of view; if the line at infinity is included, left and right sides of the prism are also perpendicular to the view.</p>

<p>For k=3 (that is, arrangements with lines of three slopes), we must find a tiling of an integer side length hexagon by regular unit hexagons and 60-120 rhombi.  Two such tilings lead to simplicial arrangements without the line at infinity; they are just the near-pencils on three and four lines again.  It is not a coincidence that these resemble axonometric drawings of a cube and hexagonal prism respectively.</p>

<p>Five more tilings lead to simplicial arrangements with the line at infinity.  The first of these is the near-pencil on four lines yet again, but the others do not belong to any of the known infinite families of simplicial arrangements.</p>

<p>There is one more possible hexagon-rhomb tiling, with a hexagon in the center together with two pairs of rhombs, one on the left side of the hexagon and one on the right, but this does not form a simplicial arrangement; with or without the line at infinity, the infinite faces on the left and right sides of the dual arrangement form one or two quadrilaterals.</p>

<p>More generally, the tilings for simplicial arrangements with k slopes fill a k-gon with side lengths at most equal to 2k-3; for, along any side of the filled k-gon, the edges of the tiling incident to that side must meet the side one at a time, in slope order, no three consecutive edges having the same slope.  Therefore, for any finite k, the number of simplicial arrangements with k slopes is also finite.</p>
