Just uploaded four newish papers to arxiv.  They are:

<ul>
<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.CG/0507049">The Skip Quadtree: A Simple Dynamic Data Structure for Multidimensional Data</a> (with Mike Goodrich and Jonathan Sun, from SoCG&#x27;05). Random sampling gives an efficient way of dynamizing quadtrees and performing approximate range queries with them.</li>

<br />

<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.DC/0507050">Skip-Webs: Efficient Distributed Data Structures for Multi-Dimensional Data Sets</a> (with Lars Arge and Mike Goodrich, from PODC&#x27;05). Distributed versions of tries, skip quadtrees, trapezoidal decompositions, etc.</li>

<br />

<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.CG/0507051">Confluent Layered Drawings</a> (with Mike Goodrich and Jeremy Meng, from Graph Drawing &#x27;04).  A combination of our confluent drawing idea from GD&#x27;03 with Sugiyama style layered drawings.  This is the paper that the leaning tower of Pisa logo (at right) for <a href="http://www.socg05.org/">SoCG&#x27;05</a> came from.</li>

<br />

<li><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.DS/0507053">Nonrepetitive Paths and Cycles in Graphs with Application to Sudoku</a>.  A combination of graph algorithms and rule-based puzzle solving heuristics.  I still need to figure out where to send this, maybe another combinatorial games workshop of some sort?</li>
</ul>

I also heard this week that another confluent drawing paper with Goodrich, Meng, and myself has gotten into GD&#x27;05.  Good news, because that means Jeremy has enough publications to put together a very coherent thesis.  Will upload after responding to referee suggestions.
