I just discovered that the online journal <a href="http://www.dmtcs.org/">DM&amp;TCS</a> has an RSS feed for newly published papers.  I immediately added it to the arxiv ones in the collection of feeds I check regularly.  The other online journals I made a quick check of (JGAA, EJC) don&#x27;t seem to do this, nor could I find such services for individual journals when I checked ACM and SIAM&#x27;s sites (but maybe I wasn&#x27;t looking hard enough?).  I, for one, would find such feeds a lot more convenient than the email notifications offered by many publishers.  I hope others notice and follow the example of DM&amp;TCS.

The IEEE has feeds for some of its journals. For example, TVCG has an RSS feed at http://csdl.computer.org/rss/tvcg.xml

Certain blogreaders (like bloglines) allow you to generate email addresses for mailing lists: the mails sent are then read like blog entries. Not the same thing, but it allows you a centralized collection site.
