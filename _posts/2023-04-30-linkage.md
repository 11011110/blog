* [We've already seen AI-generated peer-review for Wikipedia articles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive1125#ChatGPT_comments_at_AFD) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/110215235459028740)),</span> with such brilliant insight as:

  > This article is extensive in its coverage of such a rich topic as Ontario Highway 11. It addresses the main points of Ontario Highway 11 in a way that isn’t just understandable to a reader, but also relatable. While Ontario Highway 11 is brimming with fascinating background trivia, the article does a great job staying focused on the topic of Ontario Highway 11 without going into unnecessary detail that isn’t directly related to Ontario Highway 11. Neutral point of view without bias is maintained perfectly in this article, despite Ontario Highway 11 being such a contentious and controversial topic. Images are truly beautiful and done with expert photographic skill. They definitely enhance the reader’s understanding of Ontario Highway 11. Without them, I wouldn’t have any idea what the highway looks like. But thanks to these wonderful images, I now understand that Ontario Highway 11 is a paved road that vehicles use to travel.

  I originally asked, how long before this spreads to journal referee reports? But from second-hand reports in the comments, this has also happened already.

* San Francisco's move to prevent talented high school students from taking advanced mathematics early, pushed hard by educationist Jo Boaler with the ostensible goal of improving disparities in schooling, [has predictably failed to improve the ethnic and socioeconomic balance of the city's advanced mathematics courses](https://www.joannejacobs.com/post/algebra-for-none-fails-in-san-francisco) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/110223929076976006),</span> [via](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35595026)).

* Danpiker asks: [In how many different ways can $$n$$ circles be linked in $$\mathbb{R}^3$$?](https://mathstodon.xyz/@Danpiker/110237176309119968) It's not even entirely clear what the definition of "different" should be, and Ian Agol points out in the comments that even great circles in $$\mathbb{S}^3$$ are as-yet unclassified, pointing to [Genevieve Walsh's dissertation on the subject](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0308048).

* [There are cubic graphs that cannot be partitioned into connected subgraphs of two and four vertices](https://mathstodon.xyz/@robinhouston/110246989262052781). However, [every cubic graph with $$3n$$ vertices can be partitioned into subgraphs of size $$n$$ without isolated vertices](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/110263657563692233). The proof involves partitioning into connected subgraphs of two and three vertices, with at most one four-vertex subgraph and at least four two-vertex subgraphs, grouping these into six-vertex subgraphs, and then breaking up one or two of the six-vertex subgraphs as needed to even out the three-way partition.

* A confluent drawing style, in which vertices are connected by systems of "tracks" and are adjacent when there is a smooth curve connecting them through these tracks, allows [the Chvátal graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chv%C3%A1tal_graph) to be drawn with only a single crossing <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/110254999830816403)):</span>
