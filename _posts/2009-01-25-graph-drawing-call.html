<p>The <a href="http://facweb.cs.depaul.edu/gd2009/gdcfp2009.htm">call for papers for Graph Drawing 2009</a> is now up. The important details are that the submission deadline is May 31, the conference is September 22–25, and the location is Chicago.</p>

<p>As the call for papers describes, we're interested not only in papers about software and algorithms for visualizing “web maps, software engineering diagrams, database schemas, chemical structures and molecules” (arguably the main topic of the conference) but also about closely related topics including algorithms for geometric computing involving graphs, the mathematics of graph embeddings, user interfaces and usability studies for graph drawing systems, and applications of graph drawing in other areas.</p>

<p>So, if you haven't done so already, start thinking about what you'd like to submit!</p>
