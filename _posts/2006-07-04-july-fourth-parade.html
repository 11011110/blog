I took some 300 photos at the July Fourth parade today, so even if I end up keeping only 20% of them it will be a while until they&#x27;re all processed. In the meantime here&#x27;s a retrospective of past parades: <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/sv/j4p/index.html">2001</a>, <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/mendocino2/j4p/index.html">2002</a>, <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/mendocino4/j4p/index.html">2003</a>, <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/j4p04/index.html">2004</a>, and <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/j4p05/index.html">2005</a>. Enough to make me start to feel like a regular. I also have some photos from 1989 when we came to Mendocino for our honeymoon but I haven&#x27;t gotten around to scanning any of my old film...

You would think that with a better camera we should be able to spend less time to get the photos we want... well, haha, that&#x27;s before we learn about postprocessing. :P My family members still do not understand why it takes a month before they can see the pictures taken by me. Thankfully, they do notice that somehow my exposure and white balance are more &quot;consistent&quot;. :P

Coming to think about it, here is a picture back from SODA in Miami:

Sorry for the space.
