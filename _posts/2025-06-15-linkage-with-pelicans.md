* [Pascal's triangle over the Klein 4-group](https://mathstodon.xyz/@Log3overLog2/114615169671693298) generates a "Celtic knotwork" Hamiltonian tour of the Hanoi graph.

* This month in [lame debates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lamest_edit_wars) on Wikipedia: [should the title "square root of 4" redirect to the article on the number 2, or be deleted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Redirects_for_discussion/Log/2025_June_9#Square_root_of_4) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@VinceVatter/114597514498098403)) and [should the article on Pope Leo XIV use American-style or European-style date formats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Pope_Leo_XIV/RFC:_Date_format)?

* [The geometry of the Toysmith Flashing Neutron Multi-Sensory Ball](https://mathstodon.xyz/@JimPropp/114621721087236252). Consensus appears to be that it is the [6-pentagons link](https://www.georgehart.com/puzzles/puzzle-6pentagons.html).

* If you like pentagons in your soccer balls, they put [pentagons in your pentagons](https://mathstodon.xyz/@mjd/113743630935746929). The outer level of subdivision is a regular dodecahedron; the inner resembles the usual truncated-icosahedron buckyball Adidas Telstar soccer ball, but is actually a different polyhedron, the [chamfered dodecahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamfered_dodecahedron).

* [Why Bell Labs was so productive](https://links.fabiomanganiello.com/share/683ee70d0409e6.66273547) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://manganiello.social/notice/AukwkbWFAQDB0uXM80)).</span> Short summary: they found curiosity-driven researchers and freed them to do what they wanted without imposing short-term goals, metrics, and bureaucracy.

* I recently had to take my name off a manuscript (not yet public) because it turned out that one of the coauthors had been using ChatGPT to help them write it all along without telling the rest of us and I don't want my name on that <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/114654114056358336)).</span> Let this be a warning that, if you have expectations about this sort of thing, you should communicate them to your coauthors early.

  It didn't help that the same day I had to remove over 50% of a long Wikipedia article on algorithms because for months some editor had been using an LLM to expand it, complete with falsified references whose links went to actual papers on unrelated topics.

* [New theoretical computer science award, in honor of Luca Trevisan](https://tcsplus.wordpress.com/2025/06/10/new-tcs-award-in-honor-of-luca-trevisan/). Nomination deadline August 2025.

* Speaking of AI-written: ["Truly wasn't" should now be "was trulyn't"](https://mstdn.social/@ElleGray/114648981566871805) according to our all-knowing machine overlords at grammarly.

The Wikimedia Foundation developers, not so much, but maybe this time they got the message?

* Brown pelicans on the [abandoned fishing pier](https://www.pierfishing.com/gaviota-pier/) at [Gaviota State Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaviota_State_Park) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/114677169813712432), [previously]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2013-12-30-gaviota-state-beach %})).</span> One of our stops on a road trip from Irvine to Santa Cruz. What the Wikipedia article on the park doesn't tell you: it is much easier to visit this park southbound. Northbound, you have to do a left turn across US Highway 101 to get into the park, and then a right turn onto the highway and a U-turn on it to get back out.
