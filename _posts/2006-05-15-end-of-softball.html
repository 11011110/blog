Four more batches of photos are now in <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/riptide/">the Riptide photo directory</a> â€” the final four there. Three games, and a closing ceremony with Olympian Lisa Fernandez (rescheduled from the rained-out opening ceremony). Riptide did quite respectably, making it to the semifinals before being eliminated. The final game was tonight; Sara saw all of it while the rest of us only caught the tail end, but from what we saw the two teams were playing excellent softball, obviously deserving to be there, and we were happy to see the team that had eliminated ours go down to the winner of our division.
