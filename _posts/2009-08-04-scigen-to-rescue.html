<p>This is a real email I received this morning from a Pakistani researcher:</p>

<blockquote><p>Sir,</p>

<p>I need few research papers on my account. I am writing on my own.Because I have just 3 months and I have to complete 5 research papers. I can write 2-3 papers. I will be thankful to you if you please INCLUDE my name as 2nd, 3rd or 4th author in your research paper in any journal.</p>

<p>I will be thankful to you for that,</p>

<p>Regards,</p></blockquote>

<p>Dude, what do you need me for? Use <a href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/scigen/">SCIgen</a> and find some trash journal or conference that takes literally everything like that <a href="{{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2008-12-23-notion-that-hackers %}">Schlangemann guy did</a>.</p>

<p>(Editorial comparing the likely quality of the SCIgen papers and the 2-3 papers my correspondent intends to write himself omitted, because in a good 3 months I can write 2-3 papers myself and I have some pride in the quality of my own research. Maybe he is good enough to pull that part off. But somehow I doubt it.)</p>
