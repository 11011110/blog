Last time I did one of these posts I was in Montreal for the 3rd Joint SIAM/CAIMS Annual Meetings (AN) and its satellite conferences on geometric design (GD) and applied and computational discrete algorithms (ACDA). This time, I'm back in Canada for the Algorithms and Data Structures Symposium (WADS) and Canadian Conference on Computational Geometry (CCCG). Yes, only some of those acronyms make sense. Anyway:

* [Terry Tao on the Trump administration's ongoing attacks on research and the universities](https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/114956840959338146), this time taking hostage all funding for research at UCLA including both Tao's personal grants and the funds for the IPAM mathematics institute there.

* [Project Patti: Why can You solve diabolical puzzles on one Sudoku website but not easy puzzles on another Sudoku website?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21137) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/114965701798412335)).</span> A new preprint by Arman Eisenkolb-Vaithyanathan investigates empirically an idea that has probably been developed independently many times (for me it was in [a never-published 2005 preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0507053)): to judge the difficulty of a Sudoku puzzle you should use a computer solver that mimics human deductive reasoning rather than backtracking (much easier as backtracking may be in a solver) and look at the complexity of the deductive rules you need to use for each puzzle. Eisenkolb-Vaithyanathan analyzes this idea across thousands of puzzles from five websites and finds good correlations with the website difficulty labels.

Not a good idea to mix with user-generated content though, so it's disabled by default.

The code for generating these in OEIS looks slow and bad, but if you have a streaming generator for the usual primes, then the Fermi–Dirac primes are [easy to generate in sorted order](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/115005686641521519): just merge the primes and the squares of the recursively generated Fermi–Dirac primes.

* You probably know about the five Platonic solids, convex polyhedra that are fundamental for point symmetries.

A penny graph is a graph that you can get by pushing a bunch of pennies together, flat on a tabletop; when two pennies touch each other, that forms an edge. They are a special case of the planar graphs (which, by the circle packing theorem, are the graphs you can get in this way from circles that are not all the same size) and the matchstick graphs (planar graphs that you can draw with no crossings and with all edges of equal lengths).

  Previously it was known that determining whether a given graph is a penny graph is $$\mathsf{NP}$$-hard, based on combinatorial structures in certain penny graphs that can be used to simulate logical circuits. But it was not obvious how to certify that a graph is a penny graph by providing only combinatorial information about it (a polynomial number of bits of information), because a realization as a penny graph involves real numbers that might plausibly require a non-polynomial number of bits to specify. The new preprint resolves this issue by proving that recognizing penny graphs and their 3d analogues is as hard as any other problem that involves specifying real numbers and then checking certain algebraic properties of them (like are certain tuples of them the coordinates of points that are a unit distance apart).
