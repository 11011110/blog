After <a href="http://11011110.livejournal.com/179107.html">Southern Oregon</a> we took a drive down the north coast of California to visit my parents in Mendocino and see my mother <a href="http://www.mendocinowritersblog.com/mendocino_coast_writers_c/2009/08/maureen-eppstein-reads-from-her-new-collection-rogue-wave-at-glass-beach-1.html">give a reading from her newly published poetry book</a> (from <a href="http://www.marchstreetpress.com/">March Street Press</a>). Before Diana and I left the kids and took off for <a href="http://11011110.livejournal.com/178636.html">the Canadian Rockies</a>, we had some time for a family hike, and I pushed for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Gulch_State_Park">Russian Gulch State Park</a>, in part so that I could take <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/11011110/3869717772/">a photo</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_W._Panhorst_Bridge">the bridge</a> that now adorns the Wikipedia article on the park. But it was a very pretty hike, with a waterfall at the end, and I took some other photos as well, and even kept a few of them. <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/rgsp/index.html">Gallery here</a>.
