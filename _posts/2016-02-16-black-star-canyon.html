I spent the president&#x27;s day holiday hiking in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Star_Canyon">Black Star Canyon</a>, a wilderness area nearby enough that it&#x27;s barely outside Irvine and remote enough that in the upper part of the falls trail (where you&#x27;re basically scrambling up a creek instead of hiking along a trail) there&#x27;s no sign of civilization to be seen except for the other hikers, airplanes overhead, and occasional painted rocks.
