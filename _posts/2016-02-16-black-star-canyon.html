<p>I spent the president's day holiday hiking in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Star_Canyon">Black Star Canyon</a>, a wilderness area nearby enough that it's barely outside Irvine and remote enough that in the upper part of the falls trail (where you're basically scrambling up a creek instead of hiking along a trail) there's no sign of civilization to be seen except for the other hikers, airplanes overhead, and occasional painted rocks.</p>
