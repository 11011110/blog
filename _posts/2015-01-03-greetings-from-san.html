<p>I've just arrived in San Diego for the annual <a href="http://www.siam.org/meetings/da15/">Symposium on Discrete Algorithms</a> and its associated satellite workshops ALENEX and ANALCO. That little strip of blue on the left edge of the photo is the harbor; you can also see a little bit of it directly from the hotel, if your window faces in the right direction. If you're also here, greetings!</p>
