<p>I was up in the Bay Area this weekend with my family for a memorial service for my wife's cousin <a href="http://blog.roblox.com/2013/02/in-memory-of-erik-cassel/">Erik Cassel</a>, who died recently at a young age. Before leaving we stopped by Stevens Creek Park, a place I used to visit frequently long ago when I lived in Cupertino, and where my brother-in-law now works. <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/scp/">Some photos</a>.</p>
