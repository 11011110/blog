Ho hum, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.0229">another strange arxiv paper purporting to show a connection between P=NP and the Riemann hypothesis</a>. Except that it&#x27;s the Riemann hypothesis for finite fields (that is, the solved Riemann hypothesis, not the one that&#x27;s still open) and maybe more importantly it&#x27;s by Ketan Mulmuley rather than some unknown crank.
<br />

<br />
Anyone have more knowledge or insight about what this means?

A SIGACT News article sometime ago attempted a &quot;layman&#x27;s&quot; explanation of the Mulmuley-Sohoni work (I think titled Geometric Complexity I) in SICOMP. I couldn&#x27;t even understand the SIGACT article. 

I was talking to someone who spent an entire semester running a seminar whose goal was to understand this paper. I don&#x27;t think they finished it. 

So I have no real hopes of penetrating the new paper either ;). Although it is one of my life goals to attempt to understand at least the direction that they are trying to pursue.

There&#x27;s Kenneth W. Regan&#x27;s <a href="http://www.math.cas.cz/~pudlak/alg-geom/gctulm.pdf">&quot;Understanding the Mulmuley-Sohoni Approach to P vs. NP&quot;</a> from the BEATCS.

Thanks for the link! Maybe this is the same as the one Suresh mentions? It wouldn&#x27;t be surprising for something to be in both BEATCS and SIGACT News.
