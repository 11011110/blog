<p>At LATIN, Allan Borodin brought my attention to a recent paper of his with Yuli Ye, "<a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~bor/Papers/inductive-independence.pdf">Elimination graphs</a>" (TALG 2012), about an idea that combines local properties of graphs with degeneracy.</p>

<p>For a graph property \( P \), a graph \( G \) is "locally \( P \)" if the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbourhood_(graph_theory)">open neighborhood</a> of each vertex \( v \) in \( G \) (the subgraph of \( G \) induced by the neighbors of \( v \)) has property \( P \). For instance, a graph is locally cyclic if every vertex's neighbors induce a cycle; these are the graphs of certain well-behaved surface triangulations (every clique of the graph is a simplex in the triangulation). In the hecatohedron below, every neighborhood is a 5-cycle or a 6-cycle.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="Hecatohedron" src="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/hecatohedron.gif" /></p>

<p>Local graph properties work particularly well when \( P \) is hereditary (that is, when induced subgraphs of graphs with property \( P \) also have property \( P \)). For then the property of being locally \( P \) is also hereditary. And, in this case, being locally \( P \) is a generalization of being \( P \). For instance, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claw-free_graph">claw-free graphs</a> are exactly the locally 2-independent graphs (every neighborhood has independence number at most 2); being 2-independent and being claw-free are both hereditary. The graphs of bounded degree are exactly the locally bounded graphs (every neighborhood has constant size).</p>

<p>Analogously, Borodin and Ye define an undirected graph to be "inductively \( P \)" if its vertices can be ordered into a sequence so that, for each \( v \), the graph induced by the earlier neighbors of \( v \) in the sequence has property \( P \). Again, this works particularly well when \( P \) is hereditary, because then being inductively \( P \) is also hereditary and generalizes P. Additionally, when \( P \) is hereditary, the set of orderings in which the vertices can be removed (before reversal) forms an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimatroid">antimatroid</a>, and a valid vertex ordering can be found by a greedy algorithm that repeatedly removes a vertex from the given graph whose neighbors have property \( P \). This algorithm can remove all vertices if and only if the graph is inductively \( P \), in which case the inductive ordering is the reverse of the removal ordering. Therefore, whenever \( P \) is hereditary and can be tested in polynomial time, so can the property of being inductively \( P \).</p>

<p>With this definition, a graph has bounded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degeneracy_(graph_theory)">degeneracy</a> if and only if it is inductively bounded, with the degeneracy equal to the largest earlier-neighborhood size in an ordering that minimizes this size. A graph is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chordal_graph">chordal</a> if and only if it is inductively complete (inductively 1-independent), and the inductive ordering in this case is called an elimination ordering. In this way, Borodin and Ye formalize a common generalization of degeneracy orderings and elimination orderings. However, another standard type of vertex ordering, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfectly_orderable_graph">perfect ordering</a>, can't be defined via inductive hereditary properties, because the orderings are NP-hard to find.</p>

<p>The particular property most closely examined by Borodin and Ye is that of being inductively \( k \)-independent, which generalizes chordal graphs (\( k=1 \)), degenerate graphs (\( k={} \)degeneracy), claw-free graphs (\( k=2 \)), planar graphs (\( k=3 \), beating the degeneracy bound of 5), unit disk graphs (\( k=3 \)), and disk graphs more generally (order by radius to get \( k=5 \)). With this property, for instance, a greedy coloring in the inductive order uses at most \( k \) times the optimal number of colors (because any coloring of the earlier neighborhood of any vertex uses at most \( k \) times the number of colors that would have been used in an optimal coloring). They also show that the inductively \( k \)-independent graphs have \( (k+1) \)-approximations to their maximum weighted independent set.</p>

<p>Borodin and Ye give a time bound of \( O(n^{k+2}) \) time for recognizing inductively \( k \)-independent graphs, or \( O(n^{k+3}) \) in linear space, when \( k \) is a constant. They list improving these time bounds as their most important open problem. Here, some observations already used for recognizing claw-free graphs may help. For instance, each removed vertex can have only \( O(\sqrt{m}) \) neighbors (else its neighborhood would be too sparse to be only k-independent), an observation made in the claw-free case by <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2FS0020-0190%2800%2900047-8">Kloks, Kratsch &amp; MÃ¼ller (2000)</a>. And, when seeking a vertex to remove, only \( O(\sqrt{m}) \) of them can even have this many neighbors. This immediately improves the linear-space algorithm to \( O(nm^{(k+2)/2}) \). It seems likely that the fast matrix multiplication methods used to speed up claw-free graph recognition can also be used here to reduce the exponent (as Borodin and Ye already do for some small values of \( k \)), but I haven't worked out the details. On the other hand, one can't do much better, because a graph \( G \) has independence number at most \( k \) if and only if the graph formed from \( G \) by adding \( k+1 \) independent new vertices, each adjacent to all the original vertices, is inductively \( k \)-independent. Therefore, inductive \( k \)-independence is no easier than \( k \)-independence, and (under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_time_hypothesis">exponential time hypothesis</a>) it requires an exponent linear in \( k \) by results of <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.jcss.2006.04.007">Chen et al. (2006)</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks for the pointer to the paper of Ye-Borodin. I was not aware of it and it has triggered some nice connections for me.</p>
