<p>We returned yesterday from our holiday travels to northern California. While visiting relatives in Palo Alto we stopped by two local parks, <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/hooverpark/index.html">Hoover Park</a> with two young cousins on rollerskates, and the <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/greerpark/index.html">Greer Park Skateboard Bowl</a> with Timothy and his new board. Here's one from the skateboard bowl, though it's not of Timothy:</p>
