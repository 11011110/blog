It's been just over 50 years since my parents [moved to California](http://www.maureeneppstein.com/mve_journal/?p=1545) (from England, with me in tow, and before that from New Zealand). So over the Memorial Day weekend, together with their friend Judi Foster who moved from Texas to California around the same time, they celebrated with a picnic in Stevens Creek County Park, near Cupertino where they first moved. (Coincidentally, the same park is where my brother-in-law works now.) [My photo album from the event](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/stevenscreek/) is now online. Most of the photos in it are just family snapshots, likely uninteresting unless you're one of the subjects, but I should at least include one here of my parents themselves:

[When I last posted photos from the same park]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2013-03-17-stevens-creek-park %}), my wife's cousin Erik Cassel had just died, and we were visiting the park to choose a site for a bench in his memory.
So of course we had to come back and visit the bench.

California's drought broke this winter, so the creek and the reservoir that feeds it were full. The buckeyes were in bloom:
