title: Three CCCG videos

Three new ten-minute research talk videos by me are now up on YouTube as part of the collection of videos to be presented in the 2020 Canadian Conference on Computational Geometry. The [pdf conference program](http://vga.usask.ca/cccg2020/program.pdf) has links to all the videos. The conference includes an opportunity to interact with the speakers online, on the August 5â€“7 dates of the actual conference, with free registration at [the CCCG web site](http://vga.usask.ca/cccg2020/).

My three videos are on [dynamic products of ranks, discussed in my previous post]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2020-07-16-comparing-multi-sport %}), polyhedra that are difficult to unfold, and mathematics inspired by [the sona drawings of southwest Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lusona). For your convenience here they are more directly:

(Apologies for the weird aspect ratio. I should probably aim for a more standard 16x9 format in future.)

I also have a fourth CCCG paper, on unfolding orthogonal polyhedra, with a video produced by Joe O'Rourke. I posted about its preprint version, "[Some polycubes have no edge-unzipping]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2019-07-29-zipless-polycube %})", a year ago. Here's Joe's talk:
