Beware the Ides of February.

* Holes and their reflections ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/101517910934422997)). (The reflections are in the curved surface of an espresso portafilter.)

* [The 2019 Bridges mathematical art gallery is online!](http://gallery.bridgesmathart.org/exhibitions/2019-joint-mathematics-meetings) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/101526999074315478)). [Brian Hayes lists](https://twitter.com/bit_player/status/1086463227154915329) his favorites as being the [warped notepaper of Matt Enlow](http://gallery.bridgesmathart.org/exhibitions/2019-joint-mathematics-meetings/unsolvedmre) and the [Penrose quilt of Douglas G. Burkholder](http://gallery.bridgesmathart.org/exhibitions/2019-joint-mathematics-meetings/burkholderd).

* Some of my own favorites from this year's Bridges mathematical art gallery ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/101530712079779913)): [Fielding Brown's 3d Lissajous wood ribbon sculpture](http://gallery.bridgesmathart.org/exhibitions/2019-joint-mathematics-meetings/fieldingbrown), [Diana Davis's periodic pentagonal billiards patterns](http://gallery.bridgesmathart.org/exhibitions/2019-joint-mathematics-meetings/ddavis), [Stephen Kenney's illustration of triangle geometry](http://gallery.bridgesmathart.org/exhibitions/2019-joint-mathematics-meetings/stephen-kenney), [Elizabeth Paley's stoneware Klein bottle](http://gallery.bridgesmathart.org/exhibitions/2019-joint-mathematics-meetings/espaley), and [Anduriel Widmark's knotted glasswork](http://gallery.bridgesmathart.org/exhibitions/2019-joint-mathematics-meetings/anduriel-s-widmark).

* [Rod Downey, a New Zealand-based theoretical computer scientist who co-founded the theory of parameterized complexity, has won the Rutherford Medal, New Zealand's highest science award](https://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/ourchangingworld/audio/2018667030/mathematician-wins-top-science-award) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/101537786624226744)). Somehow I missed this when it came around last October.

* [Hannah Bast's slides on the European Symposium on Algorithms 2018 Track B experiment](http://ad-publications.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/ESA_experiment_Bast_2018.pdf) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/101543698645665393)).  (two independent program committees decided on the same set of papers and then the conference accepted the union of their acceptances). Some conclusions: the initial scoring is remarkably consistent, and per-paper discussions to reconcile differences of scoring are useful, but the final decision on which "gray zone" papers to keep is random and could be replaced by a simple threshold.

* [_Quanta_ writes up recent progress](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-sum-product-problem-shows-how-addition-and-multiplication-constrain-each-other-20190206/) on the [Erdős–Szemerédi sum-product problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93Szemer%C3%A9di_theorem), that any set of numbers must either have many distinct pairwise sums or many distinct products ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/101549376500085965)). Progress: "many" increased from $$\Omega(n^{4/3+1/1509})$$ to $$\Omega(n^{4/3+5/5277})$$.

* [How to handle journal referees who ask authors to add unjustified citations to their own papers?](https://retractionwatch.com/2019/02/07/the-case-of-the-reviewer-who-said-cite-me-or-i-wont-recommend-acceptance-of-your-work/) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/101552010373686789)).  Is their misbehavior protected by the anonymity of peer review or can they be publicly named and shamed?

* The Cal Poly ag students have started selling these blood oranges at the local farmer's market, as they do every year around this time, only $1 for five. In the summer they sell sweet corn on the cob. ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/101557509103586528)).

* [Turing patterns in shark skin](https://www.quantamagazine.org/ancient-turing-pattern-builds-feathers-hair-and-now-shark-skin-20190102/) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/101570379158959818), [original paper](http://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aau5484)). Researchers at the University of Florida led by Gareth Fraser and his student Rory Cooper used reaction-diffusion patterns (also named [Turing patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_pattern) after Turing's early work) to model the distribution of scales on sharks, and performed knockdown experiments to validate their model in vivo.

* Did you know that two different graphs with 81 vertices and 20 edges/vertex are famous enough to have Wikipedia articles? ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/101578088028534617)).  The strongly regular [Brouwer–Haemers graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brouwer%E2%80%93Haemers_graph) connects elements of GF(81) that differ by a fourth power. The [Sudoku graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku_graph) connects cells of a Sudoku grid that should be unequal. Sudoku puzzles are instances of precoloring extension on this graph. Unfortunately the natural graphs on the 81 cards of Set have degree ≠ 20...

* [Josh "cortex" Millard describes how he made a stained glass Menger sponge](http://joshmillard.com/sgmenger/) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mastodon.social/@joshmillard/101580889806746340)).

* Jacob Siehler labels cubic graphs with binary strings of length 5 so that all labels appear once and each vertex is the xor of its neighbors ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@jsiehler/101586101859381152)). He can do three vertex-transitive 32-vertex graphs: the Dyck graph, an expansion of the vertices of $$K_{4,4}$$ into four cycles, and another one I don't know.

* Four of [Conway's five $1000-prize problems](https://oeis.org/A248380/a248380.pdf) remain unsolved ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/101592412607547272)): the dead fly problem on spacing of [point sets that touch all large convex sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danzer_set), [existence of a 99-vertex graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_99-graph_problem) with each edge in a unique triangle and each non-edge the diagonal of a unique quadrilateral, the [thrackle conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrackle), on graphs drawn so all edges cross once, and who wins [Sylver coinage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylver_coinage) after move 16? 

* [The list of accepted papers](http://eecs.oregonstate.edu/socg19/accepted.html) from this year's Symposium on Computational Geometry just came out ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/101600288486356446)).
