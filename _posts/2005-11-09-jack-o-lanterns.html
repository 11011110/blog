<p>Closing out the Halloween photos, <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/pumpkins05/index.html">this year&#x27;s family jack-o-lanterns</a>.</p>

<p>The technique I used for processing most of the later ones was a little unusual: I used Adobe Camera Raw (as I usually do, in part for its richer color and better shadow detail) but overlaid with the results of converting the same files with Canon&#x27;s software, using a mask so that the Canon part was visible only in the overexposed highlights.  Adobe was making those parts too solidly yellow, while Canon left more detail visible and used a softer white-yellow that I liked better.  I&#x27;ve been overlaying two versions of the same photo reasonably often before, typically with greatly differing exposure compensation levels, to preserve highlight color and detail while correctly exposing the rest, but I think this is the first time I&#x27;ve done it with versions converted at the same exposure by two different pieces of software.</p>

What canon software is this ? is it a free download ? I have the older Canon Rebel (the one that came out 2 years ago), and don&#x27;t have the latest version of photoshop (that can take RAW format files).

File Viewer Utility.  It came with the camera (mine&#x27;s a D60, even older than your Rebel); I think it must at least have been upgradable online because the version I&#x27;m running now is native for OS X and I don&#x27;t think it was that way originally.  In general I&#x27;m much happier with Adobe Camera Raw than FVU: the user interface is much nicer, it&#x27;s a lot easier and more reproducable to set the white balance, it gives me more control of contrast etc, it doesn&#x27;t screw up the purples the way FVU does, it&#x27;s much faster, and as I said in the post it gives generally richer colors and better shadow detail.  But FVU does seem to do better than ACR with yellowy orange colors; not just the candlelight in these pictures, but also pumpkins in sunlight.

I&#x27;m still using Photoshop 7, but bought Camera Raw as an add-on.  Don&#x27;t know if you can still do that now that current Photoshops have it included.

I see. I don&#x27;t know what FVU is. You are right that you can&#x27;t buy the RAW plugin any more; i checked that. picasa on windows oddly enough can read the RAW format. I&#x27;ll see if i can find the canon software

<i>I don&#x27;t know what FVU is.</i>

Canon keep changing the names of their software.  It may be the same thing as ZoomBrowser or Image Browser.
