<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_tessellation">Gilbert tessellation</a>, a mathematical model of mud crack formation closely related to <a href="http://www.cs.uiuc.edu/~jeffe/open/cycles.html">motorcycle graphs</a>.
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citation_graph">Citation graph</a>, a graph of academic papers and their citations to each other.
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Bubble_conjecture">Double Bubble conjecture</a> (now a theorem), the fact that the minimum-surface-area enclosure for any two volumes takes the form of three spherical patches meeting in a circle.
<br />

<br />
They&#x27;re all a bit short, in need of more detail and better illustrations, but still I think more useful than not having an article at all.

The double bubble article perhaps needs a little hint as to how a <em>double</em> bubble can consist of <em>three</em> spherical surfaces. (I worked it out in the end: the flat disk separating the two bubbles in the equal volumes case is part of a sphere with infinite radius.)

Thanks for the suggestion; I&#x27;ve rewritten that part in an attempt to clarify it.
