I&#x27;ve been working on a new Wikipedia article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linkless_embedding">linkless embedding of graphs into three-dimensional space</a>. While doing so, I uncovered an interesting 3d graph drawing problem that was asked by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horst_Sachs">Horst Sachs</a> in 1981 and appears to still be unanswered.
<br />

<br />
Linkless graphs are the graphs that can be drawn in space so that no two cycles have nonzero <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linking_number">linking number</a>. A closely related concept is that of a &quot;flat embedding&quot;, in which each cycle should be the boundary of a disk that is not crossed by any other feature of the graph; every linklessly embeddable graph has a flat embedding. I wrote about linkless graphs in my <a href="http://11011110.livejournal.com/198487.html">SoCG 2010 conference report</a>: Ken-ichi Kawarabayashi spoke at SoCG about a linear time algorithm he had developed with Kreutzer and Mohar for recognizing them and finding embeddings of them.
<br />

<br />
Sachs&#x27; question concerns spatial analogues of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A1ry%27s_theorem">Fáry&#x27;s theorem</a>, the result that any planar graph can be drawn in the plane with straight line segment edges. Linkless embeddings are defined topologically rather than geometrically: edges are allowed to be represented as curves or polygonal chains rather than as straight line segments. Does every linkless graph have a straight-line linkless embedding?
<br />

<br />
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007%2FBFb0071633">Sachs&#x27; writeup</a> actually includes a stronger problem: does every linkless embedding of a graph have a homeomorphic straight-line embedding? But as he hints, the answer to this stronger question is no: for instance, a triangle graph can be embedded in space to form a trefoil knot with curved edges, and this embedding is linkless (there are no two disjoint cycles to be linked); however, according to calculations of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stick_number">stick number</a> of the trefoil the shortest cycle that has a homeomorphic straight-line embedding is the 6-cycle. So not every linkless embedding of the triangle can be straightened. But perhaps restricting attention to flat embeddings avoids this problem: in a flat embedding, none of the cycles can be knotted. So: does every flat embedding of a graph have a homeomorphic straight-line embedding?
