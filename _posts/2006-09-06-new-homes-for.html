I haven't yet decided whether to go but it looks like there'll be a lot of interesting talks.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I went to the plenary sessions of 40SME and listened to Professor Demaine speak.  Very nice.  But there's something that bothered me about his talk.  When he spoke about the fold-and-cut problem, he did not reference your paper with himself, Bern, you, and Hayes.  Rather he spoke about a later work.  What's the story with that?  Wasn't that the first proof?  Couldn't he have worked in a citation?</p>

<p>Thanks,<br />
The Pig</p>

<p>Erik and my other coauthors are (last I heard) in some disagreement over the correctness of some details in that paper. Probably he found it most politic to avoid bringing it up. Anyway, the straight skeleton proof was earlier.</p>

<p>The Pig? I take it that's someone different from the Mudder with the pig icon?</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply.  I have gone through your excellent disk-packing paper a few times, and followed everything up until the edge-matching part.  Then things get hazy.  Of course, it's a hard problem and I'm not terribly bright. However, if I had to guess where the details in disagreement over the correctness of the paper lay, I'd surmise there.</p>

<p>No, I'm not The Mudder.  Only a pig.<br />
Thanks.</p>

To continue the story from my previous comment: my coauthors at 4OSME (I didn't go) seem to have re-convinced themselves of the correctness of the circle-packing construction. But in the process the priority for solving the problem has become more confused, because apparently circle packing works for a larger class of inputs than the earlier straight skeleton method â€” there is an issue where the folds from the straight skeleton can reflect around the sheet in an infinite sequence rather than converging to a finite fold set.
