<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest-neighbor_chain_algorithm">The nearest-neighbor chain algorithm</a>, a method for speeding up hierarchical clustering algorithms by merging pairs of clusters out-of-order while guaranteeing that the results will be the same as if the clusters were merged greedily, using a stack in a way that resembles Graham's scan for convex hulls.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._T._Williams">W. T. Williams</a>, an English-Australian botanist who helped systematize the theory of hierarchical clustering algorithms by showing that many commonly used distance functions were all really reflections of the same formula.</p>

<p>And, just for fun, <a href="http://jig.joelpomerantz.com/fun/dogsmead.html">a cross-number puzzle</a> made up by Williams in his student days.</p>

<p>Thanks to UCSD grad student Matus Telgarsky for telling me about the nearest-neighbor chain algorithm; given <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.DS/9912014">my own past work in clustering</a>, I should have known about it, but I didn't.</p>
