Every positive integer has a unique representation using a form of base-2 place-value notation (that is, the digits represent 1&#x27;s, 2&#x27;s, 4&#x27;s, 8&#x27;s, etc just as in binary notation) but where the digits are 1 and 2 rather than 0 and 1:
<br />

<br />
1
<br />
2
<br />
11
<br />
12
<br />
21
<br />
22
<br />
111
<br />
112
<br />
121
<br />
122
<br />
211
<br />
...
<br />

<br />
These same digit strings in the same ordering can also be interpreted as the ternary numbers that don&#x27;t have any 0 digits. The successor to a number is computed by finding the lowest-order non-two digit, incrementing it, and resetting all the lower-order 2&#x27;s back to 1&#x27;s. This differs from ternary, where the successor would reset all the lower-order 2&#x27;s to 0&#x27;s.
<br />

<br />
It&#x27;s also easy to add these numbers directly, by the standard right-to-left method with carries. Each carry is 0, 1, or 2; in each digit, we compute the sum of the two given digits and the previous carry, write down 1 if the sum is even and 2 if it is odd, and carry half the remaining amount.

ETA: Via <a href="http://oeis.org/A007931">OEIS</a> I find <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/3029479">&quot;A number system without a zero&quot; (Foster, Math. Mag. 1947)</a> which does the same sort of thing in decimal.
