<p>Every positive integer has a unique representation using a form of base-2 place-value notation (that is, the digits represent 1's, 2's, 4's, 8's, etc just as in binary notation) but where the digits are 1 and 2 rather than 0 and 1:</p>

<pre>1
2
11
12
21
22
111
112
121
122
211
...</pre>

<p>These same digit strings in the same ordering can also be interpreted as the ternary numbers that don't have any 0 digits. The successor to a number is computed by finding the lowest-order non-two digit, incrementing it, and resetting all the lower-order 2's back to 1's. This differs from ternary, where the successor would reset all the lower-order 2's to 0's.</p>

<p>It's also easy to add these numbers directly, by the standard right-to-left method with carries. Each carry is 0, 1, or 2; in each digit, we compute the sum of the two given digits and the previous carry, write down 1 if the sum is even and 2 if it is odd, and carry half the remaining amount.</p>

<p>ETA: Via <a href="http://oeis.org/A007931">OEIS</a> I find <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/3029479">"A number system without a zero" (Foster, Math. Mag. 1947)</a> which does the same sort of thing in decimal.</p>

<p>ETA2: For what this is good for, see <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/2012/09/26/relational-events-vs.html">this more recent post</a>.</p>
