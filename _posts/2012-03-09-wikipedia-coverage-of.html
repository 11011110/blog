<p>I just added two new Wikipedia articles on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gesellschaft_f%C3%BCr_Informatik">Gesellschaft f√ºr Informatik</a> (a major German computer science society) and their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konrad_Zuse_Medal">Konrad Zuse Medal</a>.</p>

<p>In general I've found the English-language Wikipedia's coverage of German-language topics in the sciences to be somewhat spotty. Maybe it's because of the language barrier; maybe it's because the German-language Wikipedia is itself pretty good so German speakers don't feel the need to use or improve the English one. Whatever the reason, there's plenty more to be done in that direction.</p>
