I just added two new Wikipedia articles on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gesellschaft_f%C3%BCr_Informatik">Gesellschaft f√ºr Informatik</a> (a major German computer science society) and their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konrad_Zuse_Medal">Konrad Zuse Medal</a>.
<br />

<br />
In general I&#x27;ve found the English-language Wikipedia&#x27;s coverage of German-language topics in the sciences to be somewhat spotty. Maybe it&#x27;s because of the language barrier; maybe it&#x27;s because the German-language Wikipedia is itself pretty good so German speakers don&#x27;t feel the need to use or improve the English one. Whatever the reason, there&#x27;s plenty more to be done in that direction.
