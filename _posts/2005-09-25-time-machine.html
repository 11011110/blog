Via <a href="http://ngs.ics.uci.edu/blog/?p=307">Ramesh Jain</a>: <a href="http://blog.etsy.com/timemachine.html">Interactively fly through a time-ordered display of recent etsy listing photos</a> (etsy appears to be an ebay-like site for handcrafted items).  Doesn&#x27;t seem very useful as a user interface to the site (for one thing, there&#x27;s too little control of subject matter or timescale), but it does give a good visual impression of what&#x27;s going on overall there.  And it&#x27;s an interesting twist on the usual fisheye approach to focus-of-attention issues to have the large easily viewed items around the periphery of the view and the clutter of small items in the center.

I don&#x27;t see that there&#x27;s anything specific to etsy here; I think it would be more interesting to see similar streams of photos from ebay, flickr or <a href="http://toys.telestatic.net/latest/index.php">recent LJ images</a>, but maybe the volume of images on those sites would overwhelm the spatial metaphor, e.g. forcing the navigation to slow to realtime or worse.
