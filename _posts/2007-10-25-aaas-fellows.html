The <a href="http://www.aaas.org/">AAAS</a> has just <a href="http://www.aaas.org/news/newsandnotes/inside149.shtml">announced</a> their list of new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellow_of_the_AAAS">AAAS Fellows</a> for 2007. In their &quot;Section on Information, Computing, and Communication&quot; there are 19 new fellows; they include my close colleague Mike Goodrich of UCI, Jean-Luc Gaudiot of UCI, former UCI faculty member John King (now at Michigan), complexity theorist Jin-Yi Cai of Wisconsin, and graph drawing researcher David Harel of the Weizmann Institute.

Congratulations, all!
