<p>The Dagstuhl workshop I just attended included an art exhibit, <a href="http://www.dagstuhl.de/no_cache/en/about-dagstuhl/news/detail/meldung/475/"><i>Bending Reality: Where arc and science meet</i></a>, of maps and illustrations featuring curved graphs; I had several pieces in it. It was lots of fun to see images such as <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Petersen_family.svg">this one</a> and <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Nauru_graph_3d.png">this one</a> printed out in a large size (70 x 100 cm) and framed as art, rather than just used as technical illustrations.</p>

<p>The space the exhibit was shown in consisted of four long corridors with lots of natural light from windows into an atrium area; it worked well for viewing the art, but not so well for photographing the exhibit (and my failure to bring a wide angle lens didn't help, either). Anyway, the images in the show are all better viewed directly online rather than as photographs of framed printouts. So I only kept <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/bending-reality/">a few photos as an impression of what the exhibit was like</a>.</p>

<p>Supposedly there's a plan to make a web site of the exhibit catalog; I'll link it here once it exists.</p>
