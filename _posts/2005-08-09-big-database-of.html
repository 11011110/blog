When you need to know how distance-hereditary graphs, chordal bipartite graphs, cographs, and bipartite distance-hereditary graphs are related (as I did while preparing slides for my GD05 talk), the <a href="http://wwwteo.informatik.uni-rostock.de/isgci/index.html">Information System on Graph Class Inclusions</a> and its <a href="http://wwwteo.informatik.uni-rostock.de/isgci/classes.cgi">big list of graph classes</a> are the perfect resources.
<br />

<br />
FYI: cographs are a subclass of distance-hereditary graphs, as are the bipartite distance-hereditary graphs.  Bipartite distance-hereditary graphs are also a subclass of the chordal bipartite graphs.  Chordal bipartite graphs are a subclass of the bipartite graphs, but are not a subclass of the chordal graphs.  Now you know why you need a web site to keep them straight.
