Back when he was an algorithms researcher, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Westbrook">Jeff Westbrook</a> was a co-author on one of my earliest papers, on <a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=320177">dynamic planar graph algorithms</a>. Now <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/wga-awards-winners-list-422048">he&#x27;s won his third WGA Award</a> for his television writing. Congratulations, Jeff!
