It&#x27;s carnival time again! <a href="http://www.logicnest.com/archives/117">The 37th Carnival of Mathematics</a> is now up at Logic Nest. They&#x27;re taking additional submissions through Sunday evening, too, so if you missed out on getting your post included you still have time, and if you already read the Carnival you should check back for more math.
