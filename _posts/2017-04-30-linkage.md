* [Competitive Programmer's Handbook](https://cses.fi/book.html). Although it is aimed at participants in programming competitions this new free-online book has most of the same content as an undergraduate algorithms text.

* [Owen Schuh's mathematical art](http://www.owenschuh.com/) includes ["Disturbance"](http://www.owenschuh.com/albums/work/content/detail-disturbance/), an interlocked set of white arcs on a black field that look much like a Mark Lombardi drawing.

* [Harry R. Lewis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_R._Lewis) gets a Wikipedia Good Article about him for his 70th birthday.

* [Scott Aaronson rants about calendars and time zones](http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=3221). The default time zone needs to be "wherever I will be when this event happens", not "where I was when I put this on my calendar".

* [Paint commercial](https://laughingsquid.com/incredible-underwater-sherwin-williams-paint-commercial-made-without-the-use-of-cgi/) ([G+](https://web.archive.org/web/20190218032657/https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/6ZCfvJFSyVL)) with beautiful slow-mo footage of paint streams interacting in water, and no CGI.

* [The strip pentiamond joins the ranks of the reptiles](https://mathoverflow.net/a/267401/440), in answer to a question on MathOverflow. 

* [A New Path to Equal-Angle Lines](https://www.quantamagazine.org/20170411-equiangular-lines-proof/). _Quanta_ reports on [a preprint of Balla et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06620) showing that for any fixed angle $$\theta$$, in high enough dimensions, at most a linear number of lines through the origin can all form angles of $$\theta$$ with each other. See also [an earlier paper](http://www.combinatorics.org/ojs/index.php/eljc/article/view/v7i1r55) showing that if $$\theta$$ can vary with dimension then quadratically many equiangular lines are possible.

* [A reversible cellular automaton that supports vibrating strings](https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.2060) ([G+](https://web.archive.org/web/20190218032451/https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/ChuefgyAZeF)). Via Tim Hutton, who posted a nice gif of the automaton in action.

* [Chronophotographs of birds in flight](http://timewheel.net/amazing-chronophotographs-capture-patterns-birds-flight/) by Xavi Bou, showing the time-lapse shapes made by their motion.

* [Plagiarists are now using automatic paraphrasing software](http://retractionwatch.com/2017/04/26/troubling-new-way-evade-plagiarism-detection-software-tell-used/) to evade detection. Do we need to fight fire with fire by using parameterized string matching algorithms?

* [A lizard whose scale patterns are generated by a long-term cellular automaton](https://phys.org/news/2017-04-lizard-biology-mathematics.html). The [original research paper](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v544/n7649/full/nature22031.html) was just published in _Nature_.

* [Turkey blocks Wikipedia](http://boingboing.net/2017/04/29/turkey-blocks-wikipedia.html) ([G+](https://web.archive.org/web/20190218032203/https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/gC9c8HN2ZD7)), apparently because Wikipedia refuses to prevent non-Erdogan-supporters from editing.
