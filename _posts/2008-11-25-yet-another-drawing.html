<p>I've previously posted about drawing this graph, the unique 3-regular 24-vertex symmetric graph, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2007-12-12-many-faces-of %}">here</a>, <a href="{{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2008-07-05-nauru-graph-in %}">here</a>, and <a href="{{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2008-10-26-crossings-vs-crossing %}">here</a>.</p>

<p>Today a co-author pointed me towards <a href="http://www.texample.net/tikz/">tikz</a>, a package for drawing things in TeX. And what do I find as the most recently posted example? <a href="http://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/star-graph/">The same graph</a>, drawn in yet another way. They call it the &quot;star graph&quot;, but (1) that's the name for the infinite family of Cayley graphs of S<sub>n</sub> to which it belongs, and (2) it's a bad name because a star is also a tree with one non-leaf node; the Cayley graphs have as generators a set of swaps forming a star tree. Anyway, their drawing is pretty close to my drawing of it as a hexagonal torus tiled with smaller hexagons, but with the wraparound torus edges drawn across the planar part. For comparison, here are the tikz image and my image:</p>
