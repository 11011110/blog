Just in time for my departure for <a href="http://www.siam.org/meetings/alenex10/">ALENEX</a> and <a href="http://www.siam.org/meetings/da10/">SODA</a>, a post about algorithm implementation!
<br />

<br />
This year in <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/261/">my graduate data structures class</a> I&#x27;ve moved my coverage of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Emde_Boas_tree">van Emde Boas trees</a> earlier, to part of a group of lectures on priority queues rather than later when I cover the successor problem (binary search trees). vEB trees are a little simpler when they only have to be used for prioritization, but I also think they&#x27;re more likely to be useful in that application, simply because priority queues and dictionaries are more important than successors.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, in order to test my own understanding of the subject, I wrote <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/PADS/IntegerHeap.py">a Python implementation</a> which I&#x27;m including in my <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/PADS/">PADS Python algorithms library</a>.
<br />

<br />
In Python, built-in types such as sets and dictionaries can be much faster than user-defined types because they run in native code rather than interpreted (insert rant about Snow Leopard breaking psyco here), so it turns out that for 32-bit keys my implementation needs ~256 items in the heap before it beats a naive priority queue that maintains everything in a set object and uses a linear time min(set) every time it wants to find the minimum key. My vEB tree implementation switches to a bitvector based set data structure at its lower levels, for keys that are very small integers; my testing found that using 256-bit bitvectors for 8-bit keys is a slight win over using 16-bit bitvectors for 4-bit keys.
<br />

<br />
While I was adding stuff to PADS I also fixed a deficiency in SortedSet that Mark Lawrence pointed out: the Python set object can be initialized with any iterable collection of objects, but SortedSet couldn&#x27;t. Now it can. This is an incompatible change to the API as it means that the comparison function (if any, and if not passed as a named parameter) has to come after the iterable, but it didn&#x27;t break any of my other code that uses this module and I&#x27;d be somewhat surprised if it broke anyone else&#x27;s.

Ahem. Predecessor search is the problem that must be solved for every packet arriving at an Internet router. So overall, it&#x27;s used far more often than priority queues (and there is considerable research on it in the networking community.)

Of course, from the standpoint of a Python library, you are probably right that the vEB implementation will not get much use.

[citation needed].

It is true that every packet needs to be looked up in a data structure by every router it goes through to determine how to route it. And that the data to be looked up is a small integer (a 32-bit destination IP address). I wasn&#x27;t aware that the sata structural problem to be solved in those lookups was predecessor search, though. I thought it was more of an interval search, the sort of thing that one could solve by a segment tree or interval tree (though one wants faster structures that use the integer assumption).
