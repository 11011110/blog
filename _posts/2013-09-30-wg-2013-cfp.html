The <a href="http://www.univ-orleans.fr/lifo/evenements/WG2014/?rub=cfp">call for papers</a> for the <a href="http://www.univ-orleans.fr/lifo/evenements/WG2014/">40th International Workshop on Graph-Theoretic Concepts in Computer Science</a> is now online; submissions are due March 1. The actual conference will be in late June, at a chateau near Orl√©ans, France.

For those who don&#x27;t know, WG is centered on the topic of graph algorithms, and (more than many other algorithms conferences) welcomes research involving special classes of graphs. Despite the name I think it&#x27;s more of a symposium than a workshop: that is, it consists of presentations of selected papers, which are collected in a proceedings, rather than having working groups, more informal talks about in-progress research, and no proceedings. It&#x27;s somewhat but not highly selective: for instance, in 2009, the acceptance rate was around 40%. It&#x27;s held annually, usually in central Europe. I&#x27;d go a lot more often if it weren&#x27;t so far away from me.
