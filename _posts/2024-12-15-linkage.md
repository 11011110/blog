not just algebraic computation.

See also a [related list in an annoying advent-calendar format](https://publicdomainreview.org/features/entering-the-public-domain/2025/) ([via](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42290448)). The mathematical works I saw listed include Julian Coolidge's [_A Treatise on the Circle and the Sphere_](https://archive.org/details/treatiseonthecir033247mbp) and L. E. Dickson's History of the Theory of Numbers ([v1](https://archive.org/details/historyoftheoryo01dick), [v2](https://archive.org/details/historyoftheoryo02dick_0), [v3](https://archive.org/details/historyoftheoryo03dick_0)) under life+70 rules, but these are already online as out-of-copyright at the Internet Archive.  

* While looking up polar zonohedra for [a new Wikipedia article on zonoids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zonoid) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/113620388852188746)),</span> I learned that some people use the word "zome" for a [geodesic-dome-style building in the shape of a zonohedron](https://simplydifferently.org/zome). George Hart also provides examples in his 2021 "[The Joy of Polar Zonohedra](https://archive.bridgesmathart.org/2021/bridges2021-7.pdf). If you take enough generators, these shapes converge to the surface of revolution of a (scaled) sine curve, as [Coxeter knew](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2313051), and this sort of convergence of zonohedra to something is exactly what defines the zonoids. It seems to be the case that the revolved sine curves are the extreme case of surfaces of revolution that are zonoids, and that any symmetric surface of revolution that curves more gently in the middle (like a lemon, the surface of revolution of a circular arc) should also be a zonoid, but I haven't found a reference saying so or clarifying what the right formalization of curving more gently might be.
