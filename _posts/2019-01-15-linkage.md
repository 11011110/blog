For the new year, I've decided to try to get back into taking photos more frequently, and to make it lower-overhead I'm making individual Mastodon posts for some of them rather than writing a longer blog post for every batch of photos. So that's why you see a couple of those images inline here.

* [Fitting in](https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/1579272) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@shonk/101320172170027222)). Animated GIF of 124 disks packed (supposedly optimally) on a sphere and then steregraphically projected to the plane, by Clayton Shonkwiler.

* [More animated GIFs of fluids with splashy frothy surfaces](https://twitter.com/BrunoLevy01/status/1080085027210309632) by Bruno Levy ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/101349213452607605)). The fluids are modeled as power diagrams of systems of discrete points and simulated using methods from [arXiv:1605.00568](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.00568).
See follow-up tweets for source code and long explanatory video.

* [Lots of charts and plots of the growth of arXiv.org through 2018](https://arxiv.org/help/stats/2018_by_area/index) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/101355877277070622)). In the area I moderate (cs.DS, algorithms and data structures) the number of preprints grew from 1597 in 2017 to 1767 in 2018, but this was a little below the 14% growth rate for arXiv overall, and was far outpaced by the rapid growth in cs.CV (computer vision), cs.LG (machine learning), and cs.CL (natural language processing).

* [Matsya And The Great Deluge](https://www.fortbraggalleywayart.org/the-fish-mural.html) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/101361278765845519)). Street art from Fort Bragg illustrating an ancient Indian folk tale.

* [Orange peels and fresnel integrals! Train sets! The urinal problem!](https://www.metafilter.com/178580/Orange-Peels-and-Fresnel-Integrals-Train-Sets-The-Urinal-Problem) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/101366435174480182)). Metafilter discovers [Interesting Esoterica](https://mathstodon.xyz/@esoterica).

* [_Proceedings of the Thirtieth Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA 2019)_](https://doi.org/10.1137/1.9781611975482) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/101373871420970067)). My favorite talk from the first day of SODA was "[Extremal and probabilistic results for order types](https://doi.org/10.1137/1.9781611975482.27)" (Jie Han, Yoshiharu Kohayakawa, Marcelo T. Sales, and Henrique Stagni).
Its main results are
  1. the probability that a random point set has a specific order type is upper and lower bounded by functions of the smallest size of a grid containing the order type, and
  2. every nontrivial hereditary property of point sets has probability $$1/\exp\bigl(\Theta(n\log n)\bigr)$$ of being true of random point sets.

* [Iran arrests demographers, the latest target amid an escalating crackdown on academics and activists](https://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-iran-demographer-arrests-20190107-story.html) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/101379517186873559)). One of the two arrestees is an Iranian-Australian dual citizen; the other is director of the Iranian National Institute of Population Research. The apparent reason for the arrest is that their research contradicted a political narrative of Iranian hardliners according to which Iran is suffering a population crash and must increase fertility.

* The first sighting of one of my Wikipedia illustrations in a SODA talk goes to Michał Włodarczyk's "[Losing treewidth by separating subsets](https://doi.org/10.1137/1.9781611975482.104)" ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/101389040748549759)). It concerns removing few graph vertices to reach a subgraph with some desired property. If the optimal solution removes $$k$$ vertices and graphs with the property have treewidth $$\le t$$, then his solution removes $$O(k\log t)$$ vertices and takes the same time as exactly solving $$O(\log n)$$ subproblems of size $$O(t\log t)$$.

* [Michael Mitzenmacher blogs about SODA, SOSA, ALENEX, and ANALCO](http://mybiasedcoin.blogspot.com/2019/01/analco-sosa-soda-post.html) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/101390458273110460)).
Michael was PC co-chair of [SOSA](https://simplicityinalgorithms.com/), which I was skeptical about (shouldn't all the best algorithms be simple?), but the session I attended favorably impressed me. Here's an example, a simple algorithm for [2-approximating maximum genus oriented graph embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.07460): greedily remove 2-edge paths while preserving connectivity. $$\text{#paths} \le \text{max genus} \le 2\cdot\text{#paths}$$.

* [My SODA talk slides on finding laminar 3-vertex separators](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/EppRee-SODA-19-slides.pdf) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/101396845733518307)). At the talk, someone asked about finding a maximum set of laminar 3-separators. It's NP-complete: use Uehara's "[NP-complete problems on a 3-connected cubic graph and their applications](https://www.jaist.ac.jp/~uehara/pdf/triangle.pdf)" to find cubic planar graphs whose $$\le 3$$-separators are vertex neighborhoods (so laminar separators = neighbors of independent vertices) in which maximum independent set is hard.

* Spotted on the Cambridge University Press display table at SODA ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/101402305412043483)):

[![Forbidden Configurations in Discrete Geometry on display alongside other Cambridge University Press books](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/soda-books/books-m.jpg){: style="border-style:solid;border-color:black;"}](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/soda-books/index.html)

* [Marble Marcher](https://codeparade.itch.io/marblemarcher) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/101407478247456589), [via](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18805717)). A game of guiding a marble across a dynamically changing fractal surface. The key is to use the recursive structure of the fractal to make a data structure that can handle the interactions between the marble and the fractal surface quickly enough to run in realtime.

* [A list of (respectable) open access journals in mathematics](https://thehighergeometer.wordpress.com/2019/01/13/some-serious-open-access-journals-in-mathematics/) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/101410796814360458)). [JGAA](http://jgaa.info/) and [JoCG](http://jocg.org/) not yet listed but maybe soon?

* [Wacław Szpakowski's space-filling curve art](https://www.metafilter.com/178755/Space-filling-curves-the-hard-way) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mastodon.social/@joshmillard/101415993062003559)). 

* [The De Bruijn–Erdős theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn%E2%80%93Erd%C5%91s_theorem_(graph_theory)) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/101421411362488773)): when all finite subgraphs of an infinite graph are $$k$$-colorable, so is the whole graph. Now a Good Article on Wikipedia.
