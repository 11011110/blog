<a href="http://gilkalai.wordpress.com/2008/05/07/five-open-problems-regarding-convex-polytopes/">Gil Kalai lists five open questions about polyhedra</a>. Two of them are ones I&#x27;ve worked on in a paper with Kuperberg and Ziegler:
<br />

<br />
(1) How big can the numbers of k-faces be in a polytope with n vertices and n facets? Gil asks the question for four-dimensional polytopes (where the issue is whether the numbers of edges and ridges can be larger than the numbers of vertices and facets by more than a constant factor) but the same question can be asked in any higher dimension. A simple construction forms polytopes with Omega(n^ceiling((d-1)/3))) intermediate-dimension faces and it&#x27;s reasonable to hope that&#x27;s the right answer. My paper with Kuperberg and Ziegler showed that there are cell complexes that look like 4-polytopes combinatorially and topologically but where the number of edges and vertices is  large, but it&#x27;s not obvious whether these complexes can be realized as polytopes.
<br />

<br />
(2) Are there polytopes that look simplicial in their low-dimensional faces and simple in their high dimensional faces? That is, all 2-faces should be triangles, all 3-faces tetrahedra, ..., and the same for the dual polytope. In the same paper, we showed that there are infinitely many 2-simple 2-simplicial 4-polytopes. Gil is asking for 5-simple 5-simplicial 10-polytopes.
<br />

Another of his questions, the one about whether centrally symmetric polytopes always have 3<sup>d</sup> or more faces, came up earlier in the comment threads of <a href="http://terrytao.wordpress.com/2007/03/08/open-problem-the-mahler-conjecture-on-convex-bodies/">this post by Terry Tao</a>.
