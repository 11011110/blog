[Siddharth Gupta](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~guptasid/) passed his doctoral defense today! Sid has been a student here at UC Irvine, jointly supervised by Mike Goodrich and myself, after earning a master's degree in mathematics four years ago from the [Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani â€“ Goa Campus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birla_Institute_of_Technology_and_Science,_Pilani_%E2%80%93_Goa_Campus).

I've already posted here about my joint research with Sid on [modeling real-world road networks]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2017-09-19-graphs-with-sparse %}) and [drawing clustered graphs]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2018-03-16-drawing-clustered-graphs %}). He also has a publication with Goodrich and Manny Torres on [reconstructing the evolution of road networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07239), a paper from his master's program on connected component labeling, and not-yet-published research on clustered planarity and on distance oracles for graphs. As I understand it his next step is to move to Israel, where he has accepted an offer to be a Zuckerman Postdoctoral Scholar at Ben-Gurion University, continuing his research on fixed-parameter tractability of graph algorithms.

Congratulations, Sid!
