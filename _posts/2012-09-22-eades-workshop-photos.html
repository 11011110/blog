<p>This year's Symposium on Graph Drawing, which I just returned from (bringing a cold with me), included also a satellite workshop, the <a href="http://rp-www.cs.usyd.edu.au/~visual/events/P60">Workshop on Theory and Practice of Graph Drawing on the occasion of the 60th birthday of Peter Eades</a>. (His actual birthday was last January.) Several of the speakers spoke about research that they had done that was somehow connected with Eades' work, Ulli Brandes spoke about the continuing influence of Eades' spring drawing methods, and Sue Whitesides and Frank Ruskey reminisced about past times working with Eades.</p>

<p>Anyway, I took some photos of the event, and <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/eades60/index.html">here they are</a>.</p>
