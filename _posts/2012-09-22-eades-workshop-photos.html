This year&#x27;s Symposium on Graph Drawing, which I just returned from (bringing a cold with me), included also a satellite workshop, the <a href="http://rp-www.cs.usyd.edu.au/~visual/events/P60">Workshop on Theory and Practice of Graph Drawing on the occasion of the 60th birthday of Peter Eades</a>. (His actual birthday was last January.) Several of the speakers spoke about research that they had done that was somehow connected with Eades&#x27; work, Ulli Brandes spoke about the continuing influence of Eades&#x27; spring drawing methods, and Sue Whitesides and Frank Ruskey reminisced about past times working with Eades.

Anyway, I took some photos of the event, and <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/eades60/index.html">here they are</a>.
