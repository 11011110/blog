This week I'm in Melbourne Australia (or really Hawthorn) for the [8th International Meeting on Origami in Science, Mathematics and Education (8OSME)](http://www.impactengineering.org/8OSME/) at the Swinburne University of Technology <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/112788692681812337)).</span> There are three days of four parallel sessions of talks Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, July 16â€“18 (Mine is Wednesday morning.) If you're in the Melbourne area and don't already know about this, I'm sure it's still possible to register. There's also the "Folding Australia 2024 origami convention" following on Saturday and Sunday, more on origami as an amateur art and less as a subject of academic research.

In other recent links:

* In the mid-19th century, William Rowan Hamilton tried to commercialize his work on geometric symmetry by marketing a puzzle / game involving finding polygons through all the vertices of a dodecahedron <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/112712391899187818)).</span> It was not a commercial success, and only a handful of copies of his game are known to survive, but this work is the reason we now call cycles through all vertices of a graph Hamiltonian cycles. See [the Wikipedia article on Hamilton's icosian game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icosian_game), newly promoted to Good Article.

* [Lance Fortnow sorts out the difference between complexity classes $$\mathsf{E}$$ and $$\mathsf{EXP}$$](https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2024/06/e-versus-exp.html) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://fediscience.org/@fortnow/112683177063396147)).</span> The one with the shorter name is the more restrictive: single-exponential time in the input size. The other one allows times that are exponential in any polynomial of the input size. This leads to a quick proof that for instance <span style="white-space:nowrap">$$\mathsf{E}\ne\mathsf{PSPACE}$$,</span> because they don't have the same closure properties. Unfortunately not all publications on this subject follow the standardization of this nomenclature.

* [Book I of Euclid's _Elements_ formalized in Lean4](https://doi.org/doi:10.7282/t3-cb1v-a415) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@highergeometer/112710341715687274)),</span> using [System E by Avigad, Dean, and Mumma](https://arxiv.org/abs/0810.4315), intended to formalize rather than replace the diagrammatic reasoning frequent in Euclid.

* [Bruno Postle on Piranesi's fake perspectives and how to model them mathematically](https://medium.com/@brunopostle/piranesis-perspective-trick-6bcd7a754da9) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@brunopostle@mastodon.xyz/112722749308730400)).</span> For instance, a perspective view of a sequence of repeated arches should show them in different shapes (you can see farther into the arches that you have a more direct view of) but Piranesi drew them as scaled copies of the same arch. Postle suggests that this gives more pleasing perspective drawings than true perspective for other similar subjects, such as rows of buildings along a street.

* [An asymptotic expansion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptotic_expansion) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/112735673192130487))</span> is a mathematical series that diverges, but that still provides a useful approximation to something if you truncate it early enough. Maybe the most famous is the Stirling series, the infinite power series approximation to the factorial that when truncated gives [Stirling's approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling%27s_approximation). The full series is divergent, for any fixed value of the factorial, but it takes a lot of terms to diverge and gets very accurate before it does.

  I'm convinced there are non-mathematical situations that have analogous behavior. One I frequently encounter involves the bots set loose on Wikipedia to clean up the citations to the literature in the references of Wikipedia articles. Usually, a bot-cleaned citation is better than a hand-written citation, so it is useful to have a bot clean the citations. Once or twice. But the bots tend to run over the same citations many times, occasionally introducing minor errors, like adding a doi that turns out to point to something related to the citation rather than the citation itself. After that point, repeated passes of the bot can amplify the mistake in the citation until it eventually becomes so garbled that one cannot tell what it was originally intended to refer to.

  Is there a name for this real-world phenomenon?

It's the creativity in design not the hand work that makes her art interesting to me.

A [recent post on Boing Boing](https://boingboing.net/2024/07/12/why-roller-coaster-loops-arent-circular.html) led me down a rabbit hole of [earlier](https://www.vox.com/videos/2022/6/29/23188504/roller-coaster-loops-circular-g-force) and [earlier](https://gizmodo.com/why-roller-coaster-loops-are-never-circular-1549063718) posts and explanatory videos seemingly converging here. The basic idea is to even out the forces resulting in the characteristic teardrop shape of roller-coaster vertical loops. Pendrill discusses whether centripetal or total acceleration should be balanced, the question of sudden-onset increased acceleration versus a gradual ramp-up, the different shapes that result from these choices, approximations involving replacing parts of the loop by circular arcs, and some ideas on how to tell the difference.
