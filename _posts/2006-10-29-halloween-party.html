<p>For once I have this year's <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/hw06/index.html">Halloween party photos</a> ready before the actual date of Halloween... Sara and Diana, sadly, had to miss the party due to a conflicting Girl Scout event, but Timothy and I went and enjoyed the usual activities: crafts, races, playing on the playground and in the bounce house, parading and showing off costumes for the kids; conversing with each other and vaguely keeping an eye on their kids for the adults.</p>

<p>Timothy's lizard mask, predictably, didn't stay on for long. We had the usual assortment of princesses, superheroes, and commercial costumes, but also as usual some very creative and original home-made costumes; my favorite was the boy who showed up as a bunch of grapes (green balloons attached to his shirt).</p>
