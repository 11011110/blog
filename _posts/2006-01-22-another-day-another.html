Now in Miami, where instead of being (crisp and cool / amazingly nice for NYC in January) it&#x27;s warm and humid. Still quite pleasant, though, and if you want cool and crisp just step inside any building, they air-condition even in January. Even coming in late at night I can see what <a href="http://geomblog.blogspot.com/2006/01/soda-report-alenex.html">Suresh says</a> about the lack of restaurants or anything else interesting near the hotel. While I&#x27;m kvetching, the hotel gave me a smoking room by default, which I had to get changed, the front desk doesn&#x27;t pick up the phone, the new room is very spacious but has only double beds instead of a king (they told me it would be a queen but it&#x27;s not), the TV doesn&#x27;t work (I don&#x27;t really care, but one of the other people I came in with did and was told he couldn&#x27;t get a room with a working TV until tomorrow — I only discovered the problem with mine after hearing of his experience), and the pricy internet service is only hardwired (maybe I should have brought one of my airport bases after all — and why is it only the cheaper family hotels that include internet as part of the base room rate?).  Nothing really horrible but for $125 one expects much better, especially when we&#x27;re only here in this city under duress after voting for a much more interesting location (San Juan).  Let&#x27;s hope the quality of the SODA talks and discussions with other participants outweigh these minor negatives.

<b>ETA:</b> On the plus side, or at least mildly amusing: Jeff E. is apparently sharing his music with the whole hotel. A lot of mashups and &quot;weird shit&quot; compared to the indiefolkrock I more usually listen to. I need sleep, maybe will check out in more detail later. Spent some time on the plane exchanging musical tastes with Ravi — of what I listened to, I especially liked Gustavo Santaolalla, Hougaku New Wave, and something else that I&#x27;ll have to check back on him for (Oulou ??) while he seemed most favorably impressed with Waits&#x27; <i>Mule Variations</i> (or at least Chocolate Jesus off that album).

<b>ETA2:</b> Loud airplane noises at 1AM do not further endear this hotel to me.
