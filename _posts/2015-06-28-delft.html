<p>I arrived a day early in the Netherlands for Computational Geometry Week, to allow me longer to get used to the nine-hour time change. One of the things I did with the extra time was to visit Delft, one of many pretty Dutch canal cities, which turned out to be holding a fun flea market that day as well as some sort of children's marching band competition. I didn't take any photos of those, but I did get some from a tour of the Royal Delft Museum and Factory there. Royal Delft is probably best known for its ornamental blue-and-white painted plates, but I was more interested in their architectural ceramics:</p>
