I took the Tuesday of my week in the Netherlands off, to go sightseeing in Amsterdam. We ended up spending much of the day sitting on canal boats and touring the Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh Museum, but we also found a nice tapas restaurant on Spuistraat (from which I took the following photo) and an interesting neighborhood nearby heavily covered in graffiti (most of the rest of <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/amsterdam/index.html">the gallery</a>).
