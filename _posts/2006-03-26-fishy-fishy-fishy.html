After <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/11011110/118258014/">some discussion of composition in fisheye photography</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/11011110/113748939/">defishing software</a> on two of my flickr shots, I thought it might be a good idea to be able to find all the fisheyes. So I tagged them, with <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/11011110/tags/fisheye/">fisheye</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/11011110/tags/defished/">defished</a> (the latter for fisheye photos that have been converted in software to a rectilinear wide angle).
<br />

<br />
Also, I put up <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/riptide/kf/">another batch of softball photos</a> including, as promised, some fisheye shots in the dugout.
<br />
<b>ETA:</b> And <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/nats/cubs/">another batch of little league photos</a>.

How are we suppose to read these blog entries when some some seemingly unmovable menu items is sitting on top

Scroll down?

Sometimes livejournal&#x27;s CSS server seems to be doing something wrong, leaving the entry pages an unformatted mess. Reloading usually helps.
