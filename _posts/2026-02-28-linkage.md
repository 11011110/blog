* [Joe Halpern (1953–2026)](https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2026/02/joe-halpern-1953-2025.html) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://fediscience.org/@fortnow/116079149514594859)).</span> A leader in the mathematical reasoning about knowledge, founder of the Computing Research Repository (later the CS branch of arXiv), and recipient of the Gödel Prize and Dijkstra Prize.

* [The circle packing theorem](https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_packing_theorem) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/116089008320752670)):</span> every planar graph can be represented by the tangencies of a system of non-overlapping circles. This theorem was proved by Koebe in 1936, and popularized in the 1980s by Fields medalist William Thurston as a discrete analogue to conformal mapping and uniformization. Its Wikipedia article was created by Oded Schramm in 2008, not long before his untimely mountaineering death. In his own research, Schramm found deep analogies between random walks on circle packings and Brownian motion. My interests in circle packing relate to its use in drawing graphs, constructing polyhedra for given graphs, modeling soap bubble foams, and finding planar separators. And others have found even more varied applications from the study of discrete symmetry groups of hyperbolic space to methods for visualizing the functional areas of the human brain, spread out into a flattened map. Now a Good Article on Wikipedia.

* Two new papers on near-linear shortest path search in dense graphs with negative edge weights <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/116096264936888829)).</span> I don't know the story here, but when parallel papers claiming the same strong result come out simultaneously on arXiv, it's usually not a coincidence. The papers are:

  * "An $$n^{2+o(1)}$$ time algorithm for single-source negative weight shortest paths", Sanjeev Khanna & Junkai Song, [arXiv:2602.16638](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16638)

  * "Bellman-Ford in almost-linear time for dense graphs", George Z. Li, Jason Li, & Junkai Zhang, [arXiv:2602.16153](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16153)

* I recently posted about [archive.today (also archive.is, archive.ph, archive.fo, archive.li, archive.md, and archive.vn) using its archive links to launch a ddos attack]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2026-02-15-linkage %}) against a blogger they accused of doxing them <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/116104534242592536)).</span> That attack triggered Wikipedia (at least, the English part) to discuss banning archive.today links, and the ensuing discussion turned up evidence that (as part of the same dispute with the same blogger) [archive.today had also tampered with its archived content](https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Archive.is_RFC_5#Evidence_of_altering_snapshots) to falsify certain names in old archived links. This led to a quick close of the discussion and a [consensus to remove all archive.today links from Wikipedia](https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Archive.today_guidance). For the same reasons I have removed all archive.today links from my blog, where I had been occasionally using them as a convenient way to access paywalled content. I suggest that others remove their links as well, lest you unwittingly become part of additional ddos attacks and falsification.

* ["Google just keeps getting dumber"](https://mathstodon.xyz/@oantolin/116132973840586259). The link goes to a screenshot of a Google Books page for the book _Topics in Topology_ by Stevo Todorčević, displaying the plot summary "a thirteen-year-old with a talent for throwing loops and who lives on a ranch with his father and grandfather yearns for a roping horse".

* [According to the Bonnet theorem](https://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonnet_theorem) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/116140012643288555)),</span> describing the surface distances and principal curvatures of a smooth 2d surface is enough to determine a local embedding of the surface (an immersion) into 3d. A related result by H. Blaine Lawson and Renato de Azevedo Tribuzy shows that using mean curvature instead of the principle curvatures is almost enough: for a smooth compact surface and non-constant mean curvature, there can be at most two immersions. The recent paper "[Compact Bonnet pairs: isometric tori with the same curvatures](https://
doi.org/10.1007/s10240-025-00159-z)" (Bobenko, Hoffmann & Sageman-Furnas, _Pub. Math. de l'HÉS_ 2025) shows that the case of two immersions can actually happen: there are pairs of immersed tori in 3d with different shapes in 3d but the same surface distances and mean curvatures. Recently described in _Quanta_: "[two twisty shapes resolve a centuries-old topology puzzle](https://www.
quantamagazine.org/two-twisty-shapes-resolve-a-centuries-old-topology-puzzle-20260120/)".
