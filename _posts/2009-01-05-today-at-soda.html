Rather than spending much time blogging about SODA today, I spent the time instead updating the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davenport%E2%80%93Schinzel_sequence">Wikipedia article on Davenportâ€“Schinzel sequences</a> with Gabriel Nivasch&#x27;s new and very nice results tightening the bounds for the order-3 and even-order cases of these sequences.
<br />

<br />
Gabriel deservedly won the best student paper award at SODA for these results, a preprint of which can be found at <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0807.0484">arXiv:0807.0484</a>.
<br />

<br />
Given how efficiently I was corrected about the mistake I made in <a href="http://11011110.livejournal.com/159755.html">yesterday&#x27;s post</a> (I had given a too-large time bound for the planar Steiner tree PTAS, now fixed I hope), I hope any necessary corrections to these edits will be equally efficient.
