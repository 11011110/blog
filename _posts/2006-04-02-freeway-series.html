Went to the Angels&#x27; exhibition game today against the Dodgers with my daughter&#x27;s softball team â€” <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/riptide/angels/">photos here</a>. As usual, the team&#x27;s nosebleed seats were too high to even attempt much action photography, though they were fine for watching the game, so instead just took a few of the stadium and the spectators. The kids seemed to spend more time going off to buy Dippin&#x27; Dots than in their seats, and I don&#x27;t remember a whole lot of excitement in the game (though there were a lot of substitutions and several players hit by balls), but I think a good time was had by all.
