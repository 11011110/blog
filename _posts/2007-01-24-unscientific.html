<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v445/n7126/full/445347a.html">Scientific publishers launch disinformation campaign against open-access scientific publication</a>. Specifically, they don&#x27;t want grant agencies to require researchers to make their results public, so they&#x27;re calling any such requirement &quot;censorship&quot;. Newspeak at its best. Sadly, it&#x27;s not just the usual <s>scam artists</s>commercial scientific publishing houses such as Elsevier and Wiley that are involved: it&#x27;s also the American Chemical Society. Another great reason to take one&#x27;s own papers to journals not controlled by these groups. <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/_scientists_/848179.html">Via</a> <b><a href="http://janitor_x.livejournal.com/"><img src="http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif" alt="[info]" width="17" height="17" style="vertical-align: bottom; border: 0;" />janitor_x</a></b>.

Oh, my.

And <i>Nature</i> is certainly taking the gloves off in its reporting of the matter, too.

Yeah, I was happy to see <i>Nature</i> taking a side in this, at least.

Hah! Is that the first time anyone has had the audacity to describe it as censorship when something is <em>caused</em> to be published, I wonder?

Sadly, I suspect that it&#x27;s far from the first. But I don&#x27;t know of any prominent precendents.

Since the Nature article is not public, it&#x27;s contents are irrelevant.

An interestingly head-in-the-sand attitude. But many subscription-only articles such as those in Nature can be accessed easily enough by most members of the public, by walking into the library of the nearest public university.
