<p>We made our annual trip to Tanaka Farms, the local pumpkin patch across the street from the old location of the kids' school, this afternoon. Timothy found his pumpkin within five minutes of arriving, while the rest of us took much longer to decide. Sara wanted huge pumpkins bigger than she could lift, but we eventually talked her down to something more reasonable. <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/tanaka06/index.html">Photos here</a>, all taken with the fisheye.</p>
