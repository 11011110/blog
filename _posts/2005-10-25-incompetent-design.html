Ayala speaks on ID at UCLA.  Rather than bastardize any of his points third-hand, I&#x27;ll just point to <a href="http://www.markarkleiman.com/archives/spirituality_and_religion_/2005/10/id_incompetent_design.php">Mark Kleiman&#x27;s excellent summary</a>.  Unfortunately the people who need convincing are not the type to be persuaded by rational debate...
<br />

<br />
And on a vaguely related point: to some extent this sort of thing is what all the <a href="http://geomblog.blogspot.com/2005/10/focs-panel-discussion-soundbite.html">fuss at FOCS</a> is about: how do we get to the point where the issues we care about in TCS are common currency on a major political blog?  I don&#x27;t think the biologists see this as the debate they&#x27;d like to be having, though â€” it seems so pre-enlightenment.

Pre-enlightenment ? Do you mean that post-enlightenment, it is taken for granted that scientific discourse is a part of the general popular discussion set ?

I mean that the ID proponents seem in general to want to revert to pre-enlightenment ways of thinking.

<small>Ignore the wrong-login response.  Sorry about that.</small>

Anyway, no, I think the idea of publicizing our work to society is a good one.  I just think it&#x27;s ironic that the biologists are getting the attention we think we want, but not in a way they&#x27;re likely to be happy about. A counterexample to the &quot;any news is good news&quot; theory of publicity.
