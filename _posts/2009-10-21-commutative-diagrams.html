<a href="http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/10/aesthetics_of_commutative_diag.html">Aesthetics of commutative diagrams</a>. An interesting discussion of graph drawing in the context of graphs that represent mathematical formulas. Does one lay them out in a nice grid pattern which makes the formulas easier to read, or does one choose a less uniform vertex placement in which the global shape of the diagram (its outside face) conveys the intended meaning of the diagram?
