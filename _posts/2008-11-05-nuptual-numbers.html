The California State Supreme Court has determine that marriage laws that don&#x27;t include homosexuals are incompatible with the state constitution.
<br />

<br />
The <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-gaymarriage5-2008nov05,0,1545381.story">electorate has declared</a> that  marriage laws that do include homosexuals are incompatible with the state constitution.
<br />

<br />
The logical conclusion is that all marriage laws are incompatible with the state constitution and that all California marriages are henceforth dissolved.
<br />

<br />
Welcome to your new freedom.

yes. we are so confused about this whole marriage thing in california, I think dissolving all marriages and starting over sounds like an excellent plan. Free love, etc?
