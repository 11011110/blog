Have I mentioned that my favorite fruit is the blackberry? I learned recently that the same is true of my cousin Angela. And my mother&#x27;s favorite is the raspberry. But my kids&#x27; are pineapple and watermelon, so so much for heredity.  Anyway, a week and a half ago my mother-in-law took us to a you-pick berry farm at Webb Ranch, Portola Valley (just north of 280 on Alpine), where (along with too many baskets of big ripe blackberries) I took <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/berrying/">these pictures</a>.
