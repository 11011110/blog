<p>Have I mentioned that my favorite fruit is the blackberry? I learned recently that the same is true of my cousin Angela. And my mother's favorite is the raspberry. But my kids' are pineapple and watermelon, so so much for heredity.  Anyway, a week and a half ago my mother-in-law took us to a you-pick berry farm at Webb Ranch, Portola Valley (just north of 280 on Alpine), where (along with too many baskets of big ripe blackberries) I took <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/berrying/">these pictures</a>.</p>
