<a href="http://www.crossref.org/guestquery/">Crossref.org</a>. You give it author and title, it gives you other bibliographic details including a DOI (the part I was looking for; basically a more-permanent version of the publisher&#x27;s official web address for the paper). The link is to their &quot;guest query&quot; page; they also have a different interface for batch queries for registered users, but I think that&#x27;s not intended for individuals.

A lot of journal sites are using it to provide links in the bibliographies of the online versions of their articles.  It&#x27;s quite a handy thing, IMO.

I have occasionally found papers with DOIs that it didn&#x27;t know about, and of course many of the more obscure journals don&#x27;t even provide DOIs, but its database seems pretty comprehensive.

Should be pretty comprehensive, indeed; it&#x27;s &quot;the official DOI link registration agency for scholarly and professional publications,&quot; according to their website, which means that if a paper has a DOI that Crossref doesn&#x27;t know about, nobody knows about it other than the publisher.  :)

(Or possibly because there was an error somewhere and the DOI printed on the paper is not the DOI actually assigned to the paper.)
