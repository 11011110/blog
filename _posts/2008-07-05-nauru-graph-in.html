You remember that genus-four surface embedding of the <a href="http://11011110.livejournal.com/124705.html">Nauru graph</a> (the unique 3-regular 24-vertex symmetric graph) that I <a href="http://11011110.livejournal.com/125931.html">couldn&#x27;t figure out how to model in SketchUp</a>? This weekend I tried modeling it again. This time I wrote a <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/0xDE/F24/nauru3d.py">Python program</a> to output a <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/0xDE/F24/nauru3d.pov">POVray program</a> to generate the model. Here it is:

<div align="center"><img src="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/0xDE/F24/nauru3d.png" border="2" style="border-color:black;" /></div>
<br />

<br />
The flat surface texture, the dark outline of the graph edges, and the rough points where the edges bend around sharp corners and don&#x27;t quite meet correctly at the corners all add up to a vaguely cartoony appearance, despite this being a high-quality antialiased raytrace, but I kind of like it that way.
<br />

<br />
On a vaguely-related note, I found my long-lost <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/a-dmitchell.html">discrepancy-for-supersampling-for-antialiasing</a> coauthor <a href="http://www.mentallandscape.com/Index.htm">Don Mitchell&#x27;s new web page</a>. Don worked for Microsoft until around 1999, when I lost track of him. Nowadays he runs two smaller graphics companies in the Seattle area.

That is the coolest looking PovRay output I have ever seen.

Nice job! Can you turn it into a 3D thing which the user can rotate by dragging with the mouse? --Gabriel

I did that some years ago with some other povray objects, <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/qtvr/">rendering them from multiple directions and putting them together into quicktime VR objects</a>. I don&#x27;t think QTVR really caught on, though, so I don&#x27;t know how useful it would be to take that route again, and I don&#x27;t even know if I can still run the programs I used to put them together. There must be some way to create rotatable things like that in Flash or Java nowadays but I don&#x27;t know much about that.
