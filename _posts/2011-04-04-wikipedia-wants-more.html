An <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2011/mar/29/wikipedia-survey-academic-contributions">interesting article on academics who edit Wikipedia</a> from the Guardian.
<br />

<br />
The quote that most resonates with me: &quot;One of the most rewarding aspects can be in helping shape the public image of their field, say contributors. For many subjects – including scholarly topics – it is very often Wikipedia pages that are the top hits on Google, and for scholars who want their field represented accurately or interestingly, contributing to Wikipedia can help.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Although he&#x27;s not the main example in the article, the Guardian also name-checks theoretical computer scientist <a href="http://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/~pwg/">Paul Goldberg</a>, who has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Paul.w.goldberg">written Wikipedia articles</a> on game-theoretic complexity classes and contributed to the article on the UK&#x27;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Excellence_Framework">Research Excellence Framework</a>.
