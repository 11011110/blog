<p>An <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2011/mar/29/wikipedia-survey-academic-contributions">interesting article on academics who edit Wikipedia</a> from the Guardian.</p>

<p>The quote that most resonates with me: "One of the most rewarding aspects can be in helping shape the public image of their field, say contributors. For many subjects – including scholarly topics – it is very often Wikipedia pages that are the top hits on Google, and for scholars who want their field represented accurately or interestingly, contributing to Wikipedia can help."</p>

<p>Although he's not the main example in the article, the Guardian also name-checks theoretical computer scientist <a href="http://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/~pwg/">Paul Goldberg</a>, who has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Paul.w.goldberg">written Wikipedia articles</a> on game-theoretic complexity classes and contributed to the article on the UK's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Excellence_Framework">Research Excellence Framework</a>.</p>
