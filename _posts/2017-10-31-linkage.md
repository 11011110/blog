* [Closing the gap between male and female biographies on the French Wikipedia](https://www.franceinter.fr/culture/wikipedia-la-revanche-des-femmes) (In French; [G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/SJzqXz9fpbx)). The corresponding project on the English Wikipedia is [Women in Red](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Women_in_Red).

* [China is cracking down on non-party-line political expression by academics](http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2017/10/10/553484924/in-china-scholars-are-being-punished-amid-growing-squeeze-on-public-expression) both in their publications and in social media ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/gGWF4woTY9y)).

* [Video of paper artist Peter Dahmen's best pop-up creations](http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2017/10/an-exquisite-collection-of-paper-pop-ups-designed-by-peter-dahmen/) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/JHNfMX8scF8)).

* ["But apart from that, what have the Romans done for us?"](http://www.asanet.org/news-events/asa-news/asa-president-eduardo-bonilla-silva-responds-chief-justice-john-roberts) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/DQ2VQcJqGhG)). A leading sociologist responds to Chief Justice Roberts' dismissal of all sociological research as "gobbledygook". See also [538 on the Supreme Court's distaste for quantitative reasoning](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-supreme-court-is-allergic-to-math/), via [+JeffE](https://plus.google.com/+JeffErickson/posts/Y93fpLXNSfc) and [@jhertzli](https://mathstodon.xyz/web/statuses/612291).

* [Napkin folding](http://www.metafilter.com/169982/Bishops-Hat-Fan-Bird-of-Paradise-Crown) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/MjiJAFJJGqX)). Like origami but with really floppy paper.

* [Numberphile video on the very big number TREE(3)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3P6DWAwwViU) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/QLb1VmcoTcm)) derived from [Kruskal's tree theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_tree_theorem). This is a key precursor to the graph minor theorem, and in the G+ comments David Roberts points to [Friedman's SSCG function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedman%27s_SSCG_function), an even more ridiculously-quickly-growing function derived in the same way from graph minors. 

* ["Blatant censorship"](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/22/climate/epa-scientists.html) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/YspVj9yurgM)). The EPA has cancelled three scheduled conference talks by its scientists about climate change.

* [Portugal takes some positive steps on digital rights management](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/10/portugal-bans-use-drm-limit-access-public-domain-works) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/bJ2vvoXEMGy)). The use of DRM on public domain works is forbidden, and cracking DRM to achieve fair use purposes is allowed.

* [Gerard Westendorp's paper flexible inside-out quartic](https://plus.google.com/100749485701818304238/posts/7Uk3B8oxcVm) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/Ra22D1WcQKx)), based on [an earlier description by Greg Egan](http://www.gregegan.net/SCIENCE/KleinQuartic/KleinQuartic.html). Westendorp subsequently posted [another version with assembly instructions](https://plus.google.com/100749485701818304238/posts/JATZhM3kdGH). The accordion folds he uses for these models cannot actually be folded as [rigid origami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_origami), and it's not clear whether there is a rigid origami version of the same shape that can be turned inside out in the same way.

* [Google scholar's "sort by date" option does not sort by publication date](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/67295/google-scholar-sort-by-date-returns-articles-from-last-year-only) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/APLv7kb9VFt)). Instead it shows you the citations that have been added to the database in the last year, sorted by when they were added, [just as Google intended it to do](https://plus.google.com/+google/posts/9EDeLFEijiG).

* [The angry dude theorem](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/284458/does-this-geometry-theorem-have-a-name) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/Rj7cxXga6nk)): if two disjoint circles are circumscribed by a third circle, the outer bitangents of the two circles are parallel to the chords of the outer circle formed by its crossings with the inner bitangents. Name given by a MathOverflow user named July based on the appearance of the resulting diagram.

* [The IMU's recommendation on the evaluation of individual researchers in the mathematical sciences](http://www.mathunion.org/fileadmin/IMU/Report/140810_Evaluation_of_Individuals_WEB.pdf) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/3WVwW8bYjp8)). "Tools such as  impact  factors  are  clearly  not  helpful  or relevant in the context of mathematical research." Now, if only we had similar statements about conference acceptance rates...

* [Anja Markiewiczâ€™s micro origami](https://origami.me/anja-markiewicz/) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/2ZrFmCaNoW8)). Like normal origami, but a lot smaller.

* [The _Journal of Computational Geometry_ is now indexed by MathSciNet](https://mathscinet.ams.org/mathscinet/search/publications.html?jourGroupId=5589) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/XVXHPGAEUjx)). Actually this has been true since at least last January but the announcement on the JoCG web site is dated from September.

* [The Atomic theory of origami](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-atomic-theory-of-origami-20171031/) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/PBrjfEsn665)). _Quanta_ describes work by Michael Assis using statistical mechanics to understand defects in [Miura folds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miura_fold).
