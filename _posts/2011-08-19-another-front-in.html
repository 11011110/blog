If you&#x27;ve seen <a href="https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts">my posts on Google+</a>, you&#x27;ll know that I&#x27;m in favor of allowing people to post and comment under long-term pseudonyms with no connection to the author&#x27;s legal name, as LiveJournal allows, and that I feel strongly enough about this to have stopped using Google+ over it. (I&#x27;m more ambivalent about purely anonymous comments because I&#x27;ve seen the antisocial behavior they can lead to.)
<br />

Anyway, today I found out that a new front has opened on the issue: scienceblogs.com (former home of biology/atheism megablog <a href="http://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/">Pharyngula</a>) has been taken over by National Geographic and changed its policy to <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/drugmonkey/2011/08/pseudonymous_blogging_at_scien.php">prohibit its bloggers from being pseudonymous</a>. Scienceblogs has been on a downward slide for some time so I don&#x27;t think the loss of pseudonymity there is a particularly big blow, but it&#x27;s a sign of which way the wind is blowing.

Another very interesting recent piece on the subject: <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/110295984969329522620/posts/ExKJZgBAYxM">an insider&#x27;s view on the nymwars at Google</a>. Apparently: Vic Gundotra is leading the anti-pseudonym charge, he is very aware that this position disadvantages women, political dissidents, and other underprivileged people (not to mention <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/08/18/google_plus_bans_real_name/">people with unusual legal names</a>), and he doesn&#x27;t care because he doesn&#x27;t think his real user base of privileged white men will care.
