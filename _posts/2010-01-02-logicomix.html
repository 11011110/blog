I had a longer and more technical post that I wanted to make but that will have to wait. In the meantime, I&#x27;ve spent much of today reading Doxiadis and Papadimitriou&#x27;s <a href="http://www.logicomix.com/en/"><i>Logicomix</i></a>, a graphic novel biography of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell">Bertrand Russell</a> and his search for the foundations of mathematics. It&#x27;s very engrossing — I had a hard time pulling myself away from it to write this post. Highly recommended.

Thanks for the book recommendation.

It&#x27;s always interesting to see people turn math into something besides dreary textbooks/journal articles.

Not all textbooks and journal articles are dreary, but I agree.

For another very non-dreary transformation of math, see the origami in <a href="http://11011110.livejournal.com/170236.html">Between the Folds</a>, now <a href="http://www.shoppbs.org/product/index.jsp?productId=3839146">available on DVD from PBS</a>.

It&#x27;s also a much quicker read than a non-graphic novel that size would be, so don&#x27;t be intimidated.
