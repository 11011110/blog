<p>I had a longer and more technical post that I wanted to make but that will have to wait. In the meantime, I've spent much of today reading Doxiadis and Papadimitriou's <a href="http://www.logicomix.com/en/"><i>Logicomix</i></a>, a graphic novel biography of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell">Bertrand Russell</a> and his search for the foundations of mathematics. It's very engrossing — I had a hard time pulling myself away from it to write this post. Highly recommended.</p>

<p>Thanks for the book recommendation.</p>

<p>It's always interesting to see people turn math into something besides dreary textbooks/journal articles.</p>

<p>Not all textbooks and journal articles are dreary, but I agree.</p>

<p>For another very non-dreary transformation of math, see the origami in <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/2009/04/30/between-folds.html">Between the Folds</a>, now <a href="http://www.shoppbs.org/product/index.jsp?productId=3839146">available on DVD from PBS</a>.</p>

<p>It's also a much quicker read than a non-graphic novel that size would be, so don't be intimidated.</p>
