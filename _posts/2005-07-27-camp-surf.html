<p>My daughter spent last week at Camp Surf, run by the YMCA in Imperial Beach, and on the last day they had an exhibition of the stuff they&#x27;d been spending the week doing.  The previous week&#x27;s day camp surfing lessons seemed to have done a lot of good, as she was one of the better surfers in her age group.  Anyway, I just finished putting up <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/campsurf/">my photos from the event</a>; here are some small previews:</p>
