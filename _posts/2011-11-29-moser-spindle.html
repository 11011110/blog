<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moser_spindle">Moser spindle</a>:</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/2011/Moser_spindle_pseudotriangulation.png" alt="The Moser spindle, drawn as a pseudotriangulation" style="background: white" /></p>

<p>Despite being a named graph, it was previously only given a paragraph in the bigger Wikipedia article on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadwiger%E2%80%93Nelson_problem">Hadwigerâ€“Nelson problem</a>, its main application, where it is used to show that one needs at least four colors to color the plane in such a way that no two points with the same color are a unit distance apart. But after seeing Peter Winkler's problem column in last month and this month's CACM I realized that it had enough other uses to warrant a separate article of its own.</p>

<p>The layout above shows that, as well as its usual embedding in the plane as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_distance_graph">unit distance graph</a>, it can also be embedded to form a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudotriangle">pointed pseudotriangulation</a> and therefore that it is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laman_graph">minimally rigid graph</a>.</p>
