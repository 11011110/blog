<p><a href="http://bled07.imfm.si/">The Sixth Slovenian International Conference on Graph Theory</a> will be held next June at Lake Bled, Slovenia, and I will be one of the invited speakers there. The conference also includes a sequence of mini-workshops; the ones that look of particular relevance to me are on computational geometry, product graphs, and configurations, but I'm sure there will be plenty of interesting talks in the others as well.</p>
