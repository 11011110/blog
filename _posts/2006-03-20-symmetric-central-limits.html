Some progress on the problem I mentioned earlier, of <a href="/2006/03/06/local-central-limit.html">density near the origin in central limits</a>. I can now handle another fairly broad case, that of centrally symmetric distributions. In fact, for these distributions, a stronger statement about density near the origin can be made, applying to all bounded-radius balls rather than merely to sufficiently large ones:
<br />

<br />
<b>Theorem:</b> Let F be a centrally symmetric distribution with bounded support on <b>R</b><sup>d</sup>, and let X<sub>i</sub> be independent draws from F. Then for any K &gt; 0 and even n, P[|Σ<sub>0≤i&lt;n</sub>X<sub>i</sub>| ≤ K] = Ω(n<sup>-d/2</sup>).
<br />

<br />
<i>Proof:</i> Consider Y = Σ<sub>0≤i&lt;n/2</sub>X<sub>i</sub> and Z = &amp;Sigma<sub>n/2≤i&lt;n</sub>-X<sub>i</sub>. Y and Z are independent, and (by symmetry) identically distributed. By an appropriate multidimensional central limit theorem (applied to the affine hull of the support of F), with constant probability both Y and Z are bounded by O(sqrt n). Partition the ball of radius O(sqrt n) into O(n<sup>d/2</sup>) subsets S<sub>j</sub>, each of diameter at most K, and let p<sub>j</sub> be the probability that Y (or Z) belongs to S<sub>j</sub>. If both Y and Z belong to the same S<sub>j</sub>, then they are within distance K of each other, so P[|Σ<sub>0≤i&lt;n</sub>X<sub>i</sub>| ≤ K] = P[|Y-Z| ≤ K] ≥ Σ<sub>j</sub>p<sub>j</sub><sup>2</sup>. But the sum of squares of a set of variables, that together add to a fixed value, is minimized when each variable is equal, so Σ<sub>j</sub>p<sub>j</sub><sup>2</sup> = Ω(n<sup>-d/2</sup>).
<br />

<br />
As a corollary, the original statement of the problem, that there exists K such that the probability of being within distance K of the origin is Ω(n<sup>-d/2</sup>) for all n (not just all even n) holds for these distributions as well. For, if n is even, it follows from the theorem above, while if n is odd, by the triangle inequality |Σ<sub>0≤i&lt;n</sub>X<sub>i</sub>| ≤ |Σ<sub>0≤i&lt;n-1</sub>X<sub>i</sub>|+|X<sub>n-1</sub>| and we can choose K to be any constant greater than the maximum possible value of |X<sub>i</sub>|. The example of a simple random walk on an integer lattice shows that this choice of K is the smallest possible.
<br />

<b>ETA:</b> The same argument seems to apply more generally to nonconstant radii, showing that P[|Σ<sub>0≤i&lt;n</sub>X<sub>i</sub>| ≤ r] = Ω(r<sup>d</sup>n<sup>-d/2</sup>) whenever r = O(sqrt n) and either n is even or r &gt; (1+ε)E[|X<sub>i</sub>|] for some constant ε &gt; 0.
