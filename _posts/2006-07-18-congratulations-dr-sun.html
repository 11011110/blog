Congratulations to Mike Goodrich&#x27;s Ph.D. student, <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~zhengsun/">Jonathan Sun</a>, who passed his thesis defense today. Jonathan worked with Mike and me on <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/a-sun.html">skip quadtrees</a>, and his thesis includes that as well as work on key distribution, peer-to-peer networks, and graph drawing. He&#x27;ll be starting a tenure-track position at <a href="http://www.usm.edu/">the University of Southern Mississippi</a> in August.

The skip-quadtree work was indeed very nice. Congratulations!
