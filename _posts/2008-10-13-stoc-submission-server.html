<a href="http://mybiasedcoin.blogspot.com/2008/10/stoc-2009-web-site-prereg-of-papers.html">STOC submissions are open</a>. The early paert of the deadline (title and abstract) is November 10, so if you work quickly you still have time to prove something, write it, and submit. And of course the SoCG deadline is some two weeks after that.
