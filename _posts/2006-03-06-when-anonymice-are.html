<p><a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/03/06/1736234">New Jersey legislature proposes to outlaw anonymous comments on internet sites</a>.</p>

<p>Actually, LiveJournal doesn't seem to require accountholders to provide legal names and addresses (or anything more than a nickname and a valid email address) so even most non-anonymous comments here would likely be banned...</p>

<p>I would say something here about how fortunately it's obviously unconstitutional, so we can trust our courts to prevent us from having to worry about the disruption this would cause, but I'm no longer very trusting in our rights being upheld by any branch of the government...</p>
