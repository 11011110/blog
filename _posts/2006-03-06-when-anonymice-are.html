<a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/03/06/1736234">New Jersey legislature proposes to outlaw anonymous comments on internet sites</a>.
<br />

<br />
Actually, LiveJournal doesn&#x27;t seem to require accountholders to provide legal names and addresses (or anything more than a nickname and a valid email address) so even most non-anonymous comments here would likely be banned...
<br />

<br />
I would say something here about how fortunately it&#x27;s obviously unconstitutional, so we can trust our courts to prevent us from having to worry about the disruption this would cause, but I&#x27;m no longer very trusting in our rights being upheld by any branch of the government...
