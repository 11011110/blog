<a href="http://makingsocg.wordpress.com/2014/06/24/voting-is-open/">Voting opened this week</a> for members of the compgeom-announce mailing list, on whether the annual Symposium on Computational Geometry should leave ACM, as the <a href="http://computationalcomplexity.org/forum/open-letter/">Conference on Computational Complexity has recently done from IEEE</a>.
<br />

<br />
There&#x27;s a lot more opinion on both sides of the issue, and arguments both for staying with ACM and for leaving, in a series of postings at <a href="http://makingsocg.wordpress.com/">MakingSoCG</a>. If you&#x27;re a compgeom-announce member, please inform yourself and then make your own opinion known through the vote. Past votes on the same issue had unconvincing results due to low turnout; we don&#x27;t want the same problem to happen again.
