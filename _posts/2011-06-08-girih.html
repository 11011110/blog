Turns out I don&#x27;t need to travel to the Alhambra to photograph <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girih_tiles">girih tiles</a>:

I found this adorning a small public restroom building near the gym on the campus of University High School in Irvine. The flyer is advertising SAT test preparation services.

You can also check out the Irvine Spectrum, modeled after the Alhambra and  copying some of the patterns you see in Granada.

Right, I&#x27;d forgotten about that one (don&#x27;t get out to the Spectrum much these days â€” we usually prefer the Big Newport for movie-going and I&#x27;m not a big shopper). I have the impression most malls are a bit leery of photography, though.

I think these tiles were quite common as a middle-eastern wallpaper style in the seventies.
