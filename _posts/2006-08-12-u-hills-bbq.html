<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/uhbbq/index.html">Some snapshots from this afternoon&#x27;s neighborhood barbecue party at the community&#x27;s new park</a>. I brought only the fisheye with me, so it&#x27;s mostly just wide angle crowd scenes.

Those are great shots.  Indeed the whole neighborhood seemed to have the time of their life.  Oh, when could I ever put up a berbecue party with my neighbors.  I think it&#x27;s going to be fun.
