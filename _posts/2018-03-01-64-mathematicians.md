For [Wikipedia's February women in mathematics edit-a-thon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Women_in_Red/Meetup/68#Participants), I had too many other things going on to keep up the same pace of article creation that I did for women in statistics last fall. But I still found the time to celebrate the accomplishments of 64 women (63 new to Wikipedia, one significantly expanded). They are:

My guess is that there are typically some 500 new Wikipedia articles on mathematicians every year, the vast majority of them men, so this is really still only a drop in the bucket. New articles on male mathematicians can usually skate by stating only their affiliation and specialty, but new articles on women face greater scrutiny, and are likely to be proposed for deletion unless they make a clear statement of why they were significant or how their significance has been recognized. Nevertheless, there are still [large numbers of women for whom such a statement would be easy to make but for whom we still have no article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Women_in_Red/Mathematics), so there's plenty more to do.
