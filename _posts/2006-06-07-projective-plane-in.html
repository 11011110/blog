<p>Suppose we have a point set S in 3d such that any line parallel to a coordinate axis intersects S in either zero or two points. If we  draw a graph by connecting pairs of points on the same line, we get a 3-regular graph, such as the one below.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/0xDE/odd-grid-pp.png" /></p>

<p>What other properties must such a graph have? For instance, they can't contain a \( K_{2,3} \) subgraph, a triangle, or a pentagon. After thinking some more about the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2006-06-04-inverted-permutohedra %}">inverse permutohedron</a> example I posted the other day, I started to wonder, do such graphs always form partial cubes?</p>

<p>Sadly, no. The one shown above isn't even bipartite.</p>

<p>If you consider the edges in only two of the three directions in such a drawing, they fall into a collection of (possibly self-crossing) cycles. If we form a surface for each cycle, and glue these surfaces together along any edges they share, we get a <i>manifold</i>, a boundaryless 2d surface.  In the case of the inverse permutohedron, this manifold has the same structure as the convex polyhedron we started with: it's topologically equivalent to a sphere even though it's embedded in the 3d grid in a very non-sphere-like way. Every face of the manifold has an even number of sides, and for a sphere that's enough to imply that the overall graph is bipartite.  But the graph shown above can't form a sphere because of its nonbipartiteness. It has 20 vertices, 30 edges, and 11 faces; therefore by <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/euler/">Euler's formula</a> it's a projective plane.</p>

<p>Incidentally, my students have convinced me to try using <a href="http://pyx.sourceforge.net/">Pyx</a>, a package for making postscript or pdf figures using Python, and the figure above was generated using it. Pyx doesn't have 3d perspective built in, so I wrote that part myself; <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/0xDE/odd-grid-pp.py">source code for the figure is here</a>.</p>
