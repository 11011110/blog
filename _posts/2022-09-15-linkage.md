* Lithophanes, a 19th-century art medium involving backlit translucent engravings, [revived via 3d printing as a single format for scientific images that blind people can read by feeling and sighted people can see](https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/08/19th-century-art-form-revived-to-make-tactile-science-graphics-for-the-blind/) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/108927524393418764),</span> [original research paper](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abq2640)).

* A quick "not a Reuleaux triangle" link: [Lego triangles](https://www.instructables.com/Lego-Triangle/), incorrectly embellished as [Lego Reuleaux triangles](https://makezine.com/article/maker-news/lego-reuleaux-triangles/) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/108933430914328377)).</span> The second link even goes on to say "I donâ€™t think [they] are quite convex enough to be proper Reuleaux triangles". And in this it's correct, if "convex" is interpreted to mean "bulgy". You can tell because the corners are right angles. Proper Reuleaux triangles would have $$120^\circ$$ corners.

* As part of a search for real-world applications of combinatorial design theory, Jeremy Kun asks: "[What is the authoritative text on combinatorial designs, anyway?](https://mathstodon.xyz/@j2kun/108936354352902797)" I suspect that the shakeup in the area caused by Peter Keevash's use of the probabilistic method has caused what used to be the authoritative texts to become obsolete.

* [Squaring the circle illusion](https://youtube.com/shorts/KYMYshbhKcw) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@henryseg/108940642070353471)).</span> Henry Segerman 3d-prints a shape that, when rotated $$180^\circ$$, changes appearance from a circle to a square. With the same area in the viewing frame, even.

* Finding a vertex-to-vertex and edge-to-edge mapping ("homomorphism") from an input directed graph to a fixed oriented tree or cycle can be either polynomial-time or <span style="white-space:nowrap">$$\mathsf{NP}$$-complete,</span> depending on the target. But [the targets for which it is <span style="white-space:nowrap">$$\mathsf{NP}$$-complete</span> are surprisingly complicated!](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/33836/complexity-of-digraph-homomorphism-to-an-oriented-cycle) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/108950099488030475))</span>  [A recent search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07528) found the smallest hard tree to have <span style="white-space:nowrap">$$20$$ vertices,</span> and the smallest hard cycle to <span style="white-space:nowrap">have $$26$$.</span>

* Tamal Dey and Yusu Wang have a new graduate-level textbook on computational topology <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/108953135639829468)):</span> _[Computational Topology for Data Analysis](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/tamaldey/book/CTDAbook/CTDAbook.pdf)_ ([Cambridge University Press, 2022](https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009099950)). [Ellen Gasparovic reviews it for the MAA](https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/computational-topology-for-data-analysis).

* [In case anyone else is looking for a topical real-world example of a depth-first traversal of a tree](https://web.archive.org/web/20220908210937/https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/09/08/world/europe/succession-royal-family.html) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/108965503136254522)).</span>

* Chegg stops pretending not to have coursework-cheating as their main business; [will no longer cooperate with university cheating investigations](https://www.chronicle.com/article/some-students-use-chegg-to-cheat-the-site-has-stopped-helping-colleges-catch-them) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/108970379605304595)).</span>

* [Schwartz's Pappus fractal](http://www.math.brown.edu/reschwar/PosterPappus/pappus.png) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/108972366289751471),</span> [explanation](http://www.math.brown.edu/reschwar/PosterPappus/pappus.pdf)). Start with two separate lines of three points $$abc$$ <span style="white-space:nowrap">and $$ABC$$.</span> By [Pappus's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pappus%27s_hexagon_theorem) the diagonal crossing points <span style="white-space:nowrap">$$\alpha=aB\cdot Ab$$,</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap">$$\beta=aC\cdot Ac$$,</span> and $$\gamma=bC\cdot Bc$$ form another line of three <span style="white-space:nowrap">points $$\alpha\beta\gamma$$.</span> Now recurse with $$abc$$ <span style="white-space:nowrap">and $$\alpha\beta\gamma$$,</span> and again with $$\alpha\beta\gamma$$ <span style="white-space:nowrap">and $$ABC$$.</span> You get a nice lightning-bolt fractal shape.

* [This year's _Graph Drawing_ conference proceedings are online](https://arxiv.org/html/2209.04402) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/108982719390301261)).</span>  As in past years, they're using a system where the proceedings are published both on arXiv and in Springer LNCS.

* [An analysis of online exam-proctoring tool Proctorio finds it completely ineffective at catching cheaters](https://ris.utwente.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/275927505/3e2a9e5b2fad237a3d35f36fa2c5f44552f2.pdf) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/108984339518916646),</span> [via](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32744976)). "The use of online proctoring is therefore best compared to taking a placebo: it has some positive influence, not because it works but because people believe that it works ... policy makers would do well to balance the cost of deploying it (which can be
considerable) against the marginal benefits of this placebo effect."

* [Lang's paper pentasia](https://langorigami.com/publication/paper-pentasia-an-aperiodic-surface-in-modular-origami/) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/108995556838713267)).</span> The kite and dart Penrose tiling lifts to a surface in 3d with two equilateral triangles per tile, overhanging for the darts. Robert Lang made these nice physical models. Explanations by [Barry Cipra on the 1993 discovery of this surface with Conway](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00283-021-10088-4) and [Lang and Barry Hayes, also on a related 3d surface for the rhombic Penrose tiling](https://langorigami.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/paper-pentasia.pdf).

  * [Euclidean minimum spanning tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_minimum_spanning_tree)

* An algorithmic version of [Mantel's theorem](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantel's theorem) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/109004244575186009)):</span> If an <span style="white-space:nowrap">$$n$$-vertex</span> graph has more than <span style="white-space:nowrap">$$\bigl\lfloor\tfrac{n^2}{4}\bigr\rfloor$$ edges</span> then we can find a triangle in it in linear time.

  _Proof:_ Delete min-degree vertices, maintaining the edge excess, until the remaining $$k$$ vertices all have <span style="white-space:nowrap">degree $$\ge\tfrac{k}{2}$$.</span> If <span style="white-space:nowrap">$$k$$ is odd,</span> all <span style="white-space:nowrap">have $$\ge \tfrac{k+1}{2}$$;</span> if <span style="white-space:nowrap">$$k$$ is even,</span> at least one <span style="white-space:nowrap">has $$\ge \tfrac{k}{2}+1$$.</span> Then a max-degree vertex and any neighbor have together <span style="white-space:nowrap">$$\ge k+1$$ incidences,</span> so by the pigeonhole principle they have a common neighbor forming a <span style="white-space:nowrap">triangle. $$\Box$$</span>
