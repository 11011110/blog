When I was asked earlier this year to write <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-27848-8_733-1">a short survey on <i>k</i>-best enumeration algorithms</a> for the Springer <i>Encyclopedia of Algorithms</i>, I wrote a first draft before checking the formatting requirements. It ended up being approximately five pages of text and seven more pages of references, and I knew I would have to cut some of that. But then I did check the format, and saw that it needed to be much shorter, approximately two pages of text and a dozen references. I don&#x27;t regret doing it this way; I think having a longer version to cut down helped me to organize the results and figure out which parts were important. But then I thought: why not make the long(er) version available too? I added a few more references, so now it&#x27;s about six pages of text and ten of references, still closer to an annotated bibliography than an in-depth survey. Here it is: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5075">arXiv:1412.5075</a>.
