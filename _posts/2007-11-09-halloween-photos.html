Nowhere near as many photos from Halloween as usual this year, mostly because the poor air quality from all the wildfires led to all the local neighborhood parties being canceled (funny, that didn&#x27;t happen in 2003 when the smoke was as bad). But I did take a few snapshots of my kids and their pumpkins. I doubt anyone but me and my family cares about these ones, but <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/halloween07/index.html">here they are</a>. Note Timothy&#x27;s Aang pumpkin: he&#x27;s an Avatar fan (as am I). We tried using little muffin shaped electric lights in place of the candles in the pumpkins â€” the pumpkin itself warms the color of the light so it doesn&#x27;t look very different, but lasts better and is less annoying to set up.
