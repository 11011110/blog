It is, of course, impossible to [subdivide an arbitrary angle into equal thirds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle_trisection) using a [compass and straightedge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straightedge_and_compass_construction) alone. But there are many known constructions that rely on other techniques. One of those techniques is the use of a [trisectrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trisectrix), a curve of a special form that is assumed to be already drawn for you, so that with your compass and straightedge you can find its crossing points with lines and circles. More strongly, some curves can be used as a "sectrix" to subdivide an angle into any given number of equal parts; these include the [Archimedean spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedean_spiral), [quadratrix of Hippias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratrix_of_Hippias), and [sine curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_curve).

The [hyperbolic spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_spiral) is closely related to all three of these sectrix curves. It is what you get when you perform a circle inversion of the Archimedean spiral, centered at the center of the spiral. The sine curve is what you get from a helix (the curve of a spiral staircase) by perpendicular projection onto a plane parallel to the axis of the helix, the quadratrix is what you get by slicing the helix by an inclined plane and then projecting it onto a plane perpendicular to the axis, and the hyperbolic spiral is what you get from a perspective projection of the helix onto a plane perpendicular to the axis. Intuitively, it's what you see [when you look straight up from a point centered at the bottom of a spiral staircase](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Golden_Spiral_by_Brad_Hammonds.jpg).

Because of its close connection to these curves, it should not be a surprise that a hyperbolic spiral can also be a sectrix, but I could not find a reference saying so. Here's a construction:

{: style="text-align:center"}
![Angle trisection using a hyperbolic spiral]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/2025/hyperbolic-spiral-trisection.svg)

The pre-given parts of the diagram are the red hyperbolic spiral, shown with its <span style="white-space:nowrap">center point $$O$$,</span> its <span style="white-space:nowrap">[asymptotic line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptotic_curve) $$AB$$</span> (the lower horizontal line), another <span style="white-space:nowrap">horizontal line $$OC$$</span> parallel to the asymptotic line through the center of the spiral, and two perpendicular <span style="white-space:nowrap">$$AO$$ and $$BC$$.</span> The horizontal offset between the vertical lines $$AO$$ <span style="white-space:nowrap">and $$BC$$</span> doesn't matter for this construction.

Given your angle to be trisected (or <span style="white-space:nowrap">$$n$$-sected),</span> place it <span style="white-space:nowrap">as $$POS$$</span> at the center of your given hyperbolic spiral. Construct circles with radii $$OP$$ <span style="white-space:nowrap">and $$OS$$</span> (the inner and outer circles of the figure), and intersect them with <span style="white-space:nowrap">line $$OC$$</span> at $$P'$$ <span style="white-space:nowrap">and $$S'$$.</span> Extend the <span style="white-space:nowrap">lines $$AP'$$</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap">and $$AS'$$</span> to cross <span style="white-space:nowrap">line $$BC$$</span> at $$P''$$ <span style="white-space:nowrap">and $$S''$$.</span> Subdivide <span style="white-space:nowrap">line segment $$P''S''$$</span> into as many equal-length pieces as desired; here I've drawn three pieces, separated at $$Q''$$ <span style="white-space:nowrap">and $$R''$$.</span> Then reverse the construction for $$Q''$$ <span style="white-space:nowrap">and $$R''$$:</span> extend the lines $$AQ''$$ <span style="white-space:nowrap">and $$AR''$$</span> to <span style="white-space:nowrap">cross $$OC$$</span> at $$Q'$$ <span style="white-space:nowrap">and $$R'$$,</span> draw circles with radii $$OQ'$$ <span style="white-space:nowrap">and $$OR'$$,</span> and find the crossing points $$Q$$ <span style="white-space:nowrap">and $$R$$</span> of these circles with the spiral. The result is that angle $$POS$$ is subdivided into three equal angles, <span style="white-space:nowrap">$$POQ$$, $$QOR$$, and $$ROS$$.</span>

Why does this work? Let's go back to the spiral staircase, and the fact that the hyperbolic spiral is its perspective projection. Here's a view of this [taken from Wikipedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Schraublinie-hyp-spirale.svg), drawn looking down from the top of the spiral staircase rather than up from the bottom:

The right side of the trisection diagram can be thought of as your view up the staircase, with <span style="white-space:nowrap">points $$PQRS$$</span> marking four equally-spaced points along the staircase, marking out angles with respect to the center axis of the staircase that are equal from your perspective at the bottom of this axis. Because it's a spiral staircase, you know that these four points are actually at equally spaced heights with respect to each other, although your view does not let you see these heights. If the staircase winds up the side of a cylindrical tower, the circles of the diagram represent your projected view of circular cross-sections of this tower (such as one of its floors).

The left side of the diagram can be thought of as a cross-section of the staircase as seen from the side. From this view, the staircase itself would appear to be a vertical sine curve, but I left this out of the diagram because it's not used in the trisection. In this side-on view, <span style="white-space:nowrap">point $$A$$</span> is the bottom center point of the staircase (from which you were looking up), and <span style="white-space:nowrap">line $$OC$$</span> is a cross-section of the horizontal plane onto which your upward view of the staircase was projected. As seen in a side-on cross-section, the cylindrical tower looks like a rectangle with two vertical sides; vertical <span style="white-space:nowrap">line $$BC$$</span> is one of these two sides, and can be thought of as a vertical line on the cylinder itself. Points <span style="white-space:nowrap">$$P''$$,</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap">$$Q''$$,</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap">$$R''$$,</span> <span style="white-space:nowrap">and $$S''$$</span> are the points on this vertical line where it crosses the cross-sections of the cylinder that you see are circles. The lines <span style="white-space:nowrap">from $$A$$</span> through these four points project them onto the viewing plane seen in cross-section <span style="white-space:nowrap">as $$OC$$.</span> In short, the left side of the diagram depicts the projection of vertical <span style="white-space:nowrap">line $$BC$$</span> from the cylinder onto the <span style="white-space:nowrap">viewing plane $$OC$$</span> of the hyperbolic spiral. Through this construction, we correspond the (unprimed) points on the staircase, the (single prime) points in your projected view of the leftmost point of each horizontal cross-section circle, and the (double prime) points, at their actual height on the cylinder in its side-on cross-section view.

Equal angles, on the right side, correspond to equal heights, on the left side. Therefore, a subdivision of an angle into equal parts, on the left, corresponds to a subdivision of a line segment into equal parts, on the right. And subdivisions of a line segment into equal parts are easy to construct.
