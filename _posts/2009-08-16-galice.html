<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/galice/index.html">Another gallery of photos</a> from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galice,_Oregon">Galice, Oregon</a>, about a half-hour drive down the Rogue River from Grant&#x27;s Pass and the jumping-off point for our recent river rafting trip on the Rogue. Mostly, though, this set was an excuse to take some informal photos of my daughter Sara.
