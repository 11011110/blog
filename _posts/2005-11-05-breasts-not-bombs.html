Heh.  The topless peace protesters I photographed in <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/j4p05/">this year&#x27;s Mendocino July 4th parade</a> have made <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-topless5nov05,0,5014123.story?coll=la-home-headlines">The LA Times</a> and <a href="http://forums.fark.com/cgi/fark/comments.pl?IDLink=1746631">Fark</a> after being prevented from doing their thing again in Sacramento.  Apparently, according to the judge, &quot;being topless is not inherently expressive&quot;.  Which I&#x27;m happy to agree with — sometimes it could just be for the purpose of getting a nice even tan — except that I&#x27;d expect the standard for whether this counts as free speech to be, not whether it&#x27;s necessarily expressive in all cases, but whether it&#x27;s expressive in this case.  Which it clearly seems to be.  I suppose there&#x27;s a reason I&#x27;m not a lawyer...
