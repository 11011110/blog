If gmail shows you an email with an attachment but says &quot;Scanning for viruses...&quot; and won&#x27;t let you actually open the attachment, try forwarding the problem email. You don&#x27;t actually have to send the forwarded email anywhere: the new-message composition window for forwarding it will show you the attachment with an accessible link.
