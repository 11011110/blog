<p>I added two new proofs to my <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/euler/">page of proofs of Euler's formula \( V-E+F=2 \) for planar graphs</a>, following suggestions from Matthias Beck.  One proof works by defining a valuation on unions of cells of a hyperplane arrangement, and embedding a given convex polytope within a hyperplane arrangement in one higher dimension in such a way that inclusion-exclusion may be easily used; the other proof involves polynomials that count the number of integer points in a scaled copy of a shape.  These integer-point-counting polynomials are studied in much greater detail in <a href="http://math.sfsu.edu/beck/ccd.html">Beck's book with Robins on integer point enumeration</a>, a preliminary version of which is available free online.</p>
