The (9<sub>5</sub>)-configuration of points and planes that I&#x27;ve been discussing is an instance of a more general family of (<i>ab</i><sub><i>a</i>+<i>b</i>-1</sub>)-configurations, formed by the intersection points of two sets of <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> lines from the two families of lines on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruled_surface">doubly ruled surface</a>. The two sets of lines in this case are the diagonals of the prism sides; they belong to a common <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperboloid">hyperboloid</a>. This also shows that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi_graph">Levi graph</a> of the configuration is vertex-transitive though I think not edge-transitive.
<br />

<br />
More generally, if we have a family of points and lines in space, with two lines per point and an equal number of points per line, such that the plane through any two coincident lines doesn&#x27;t contain any others of the points, we get a configuration from the planes through pairs of lines. It looks like it may be possible to form a 24<sub>5</sub> in this way, different from the prism one, by taking a torus tiled by a 4Ã—4 grid of quadrilaterals: use as lines the diagonals of an alternating subset of the quadrilaterals, and as points the vertices of the quadrilaterals and the points where the diagonals cross.
