Via <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/01/09/2044210">Slashdot</a>: <a href="http://dgrin.smugmug.com/gallery/1109600/">a review of Lightroom</a>, Adobe&#x27;s new digital photography tool, combining tasks of reviewing and editing folders of photos with setting the basic parameters for raw-to-jpeg conversion. I currently use iView MediaPro for the former task, and Photoshop&#x27;s Camera Raw for the latter, but I think it would be preferable to have them all in one, and then only use Photoshop itself for the images that need more serious processing.  I may wait until it&#x27;s out of beta, though, to find out how much Adobe want to charge for it; there&#x27;s no point in getting locked into a program I can&#x27;t afford.
