<p>If you're interested in Delaunay triangulations and Euclidean minimum spanning trees you should check out <a href="http://mathoverflow.net/questions/38824/what-upper-bounds-are-known-for-the-diameter-of-the-minimum-spanning-tree-of-n">this MathOverflow question</a> and Bill Thurston's answer to it. The question is: what is the asymptotic behavior of the diameter of an EMST of random points in the unit square? Thurston provides evidence that (unlike a lot of other geometric functionals) the answer isn't proportional or within log factors of proportional to \( \sqrt{n} \). He also has a fascinating physical analogy involving anti-aircraft radar stations to explain the behavior of distances in random Delaunay triangulations.</p>
