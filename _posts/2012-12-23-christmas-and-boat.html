Merry Christmas to all, or whatever else your preferred holiday greeting is.
<br />

<br />
Different people have different holiday traditions, but for me (even though the carols and decorations have been up in the stores and cafes for weeks) it just doesn&#x27;t start feeling like Christmastime until I go see the Newport Beach Parade of Lights. So <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/boatparade12/index.html">here is this year&#x27;s batch of photos from the boat parade</a>. As in previous years, many of them are intentionally motion-blurred, because I like what that does to the colored lights on the water.

Also, here&#x27;s a cellphone shot of my daughter, home from Boston for the holidays. She&#x27;s been <a href="http://instagram.com/colorfulmangos/">active on instagram</a>, and took <a href="http://instagram.com/p/Tl_hVDuuJr/">this shot of her brother</a> at the same meal.
