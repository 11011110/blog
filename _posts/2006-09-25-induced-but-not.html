Just a quick example of a graph that&#x27;s an induced subgraph of a hypercube of dimension four, but not an isometric subgraph of a hypercube of any dimension.

<br />
A more complicated but naturally arising example comes from the family of antimatroids on a set of three items, viewed as an induced subgraph of the powerset of the powerset (a hypercube of dimension eight).
<br />

<br />
A disconnected pair of vertices is an induced subgraph of a hypercube of dimension two, but not an isometric subgraph of any hypercube, but that seems too much a trick answer...
