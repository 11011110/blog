I just wrote a new and longish survey on integer sorting algorithms for Wikipedia: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_sorting">Integer sorting</a>. Feedback, corrections, and tomatoes welcome.
<br />

<br />
The Wikipedia articles on bucket sort, counting sort, and radix sort (that is, the integer sorting algorithms that are actually useful) still need help, by the way. The version of counting sort they describe is useless as part of radix sort because it only sorts numbers and not data with attached numeric keys. And the article on bucket sort focuses only on its applications to uniformly distributed real number keys, and doesn&#x27;t even mention the fact that it can be used to sort integers in time linear in the number of items and the magnitude of the keys. In fact, it explicitly says, falsely, that bucket sort does not have the same worst case time bound as counting sort. So there&#x27;s plenty more work to do in this area.
