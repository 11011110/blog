Phil Klein asked me to post that the hotel for <a href="http://focs2007.cs.brown.edu/">FOCS 2007</a> has extended its deadline for booking at the conference rate through September 23. He says that rooms are scarce in Providence for the Saturday night before FOCS (October 20), so if you hope to go to FOCS and haven&#x27;t already done so you should reserve a room immediately.
