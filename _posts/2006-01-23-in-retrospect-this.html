Apparently the easy way to increase the views for your photos on flickr is to use &quot;nude&quot; as a keyword or tag. At least it&#x27;s been working out that way for one of my photos, which doesn&#x27;t have any other reason I can think of to be viewed ten times as often as the others. The fact that the nude in question is a bronze statue doesn&#x27;t seem to be deterring the viewers...
