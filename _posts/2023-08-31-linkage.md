* [A listing of the arXiv preprints with the highest numbers of downloads](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ginsparg/top_jul2020.html) (above tens of thousands), sorted by category, as of around 2020 <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/110901313115824257)).</span> Obviously this is susceptible to being gamed if you know this is going to be measured, but in the categories I looked at, the listings included many well-known papers (and a few random ones).

* [An introduction to graph theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04512) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@sioum/110865518533023352)).</span> Free (CC0-licensed) online introductory textbook by Darij Grinberg of Drexel U.

* [Possibilities of Paper](https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2023/07/possibilities-of-paper/) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@colossal@mastodon.art/110906752951248679)).</span> A 13-artist exhibition of paperfolding art in Virginia, demonstrating the "possibilities of paper".

* [AP News article on overhauling higher education coursework to ward off AI-based cheating](https://apnews.com/article/chatgpt-cheating-ai-college-1b654b44de2d0dfa4e50bf0186137fc1) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/110911488110988585),</span> [via](https://technews.acm.org/)).

* Because of a reviewing backlog drive, I have three more new Wikipedia Good Articles <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/110916392403825432)):</span>

  * [BIT predicate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIT_predicate), a test for whether a specified bit of a given number is set. Useful for membership testing in sets represented as bitmaps.

  * [Cartesian tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_tree), a binary tree defined from a sequence of numbers by putting the minimum value as the root and recursing in the subsequences to its left and right.

  * [Herschel graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herschel_graph), the smallest non-Hamiltonian polyhedral graph

* [_Quanta_ on why it is so hard to prove computational hardness](https://www.quantamagazine.org/complexity-theorys-50-year-journey-to-the-limits-of-knowledge-20230817/) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@fortnow@fediscience.org/110918072333216087)).</span>

* [Talk slides for "Uniqueness in Puzzles and Puzzle Solving"](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/Epp-ICIAM-23.pdf) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/110926319180757813)),</span> a short talk I recently gave at the ICIAM 2023 Minisymposium on Mathematical Puzzles and Games in Theoretical Computer Science.

* "Undulation in Origami Tessellation" <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/110937398083636490)),</span> work by Rinki Imada and Tomohiro Tachi on exhibit at ICIAM 2023, Waseda University. See also their new paper "Undulations in tubular origami tessellations: A connection to area-preserving maps", _Chaos_, [doi:10.1063/5.0160803](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0160803).

* [Talk slides from many of the presentations at WADS and CCCG 2023](https://wadscccg2023.encs.concordia.ca/additional/) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/110941261988551266)),</span> on algorithms and data structures, and computational geometry, respectively, and notes from the open problem sessions of each conference, are now online. The talks themselves were not recorded.

* [For accessibility reasons, arXiv is starting to publish HTML versions of papers](https://info.arxiv.org/about/accessibility_html_papers.html) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@tomkalei@machteburch.social/110946281990368357)).</span> Still in the testing phases and not entirely bug-free.

* [Greg Egan visualizes "why a celebrity wandering through a mirrored hexagonal room would need 144 bodyguards to block one paparazzo from taking a snap"](https://www.gregegan.net/SCIENCE/Lattices/Lattices.html) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@gregeganSF/110892046291702585)).</span>

* [Theorems and Lemmas and Proofs, Oh My!](https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2023/08/theorems-and-lemmas-and-proofs-oh-my.html) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@fortnow@fediscience.org/110967165949442057)).</span> Gasarch on the classification and nomenclature of mathematical statements.

* [Not the net of a regular dodecahedron](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/archive/3/34/20230830233910%21Geometric_Net_of_a_Regular_Dodecahedron.svg) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@robinhouston/110972457980570599)).</span> A ten-year-old error on Wikimedia commons finally gets spotted and corrected. In the comments, M.-J. Dominus points to a similarly erroneous image of a MÃ¶bius strip with two edges.

* Older versions of Springer's proceedings formatting macros were unable to handle dois for papers in Springer proceedings, because they contain underscores <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/110981416610550373)).</span> I found [a StackExchange thread with two workarounds](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/550123/underscore-in-doi-in-bibtex-file) before figuring out the real fix: get rid of the old version of llncs.sty that I had in my personal LaTeX library, shadowing the updated and fixed one in TeX Live.

* [A distributive lattice of musical modes](https://mathstodon.xyz/@johncarlosbaez/110986044748102890), partially ordered by brightness, with the lattice operations being note-wise minimum and maximum. If the only two modes you use are the major and minor scales, this isn't very interesting, but there are many more possibilities.
