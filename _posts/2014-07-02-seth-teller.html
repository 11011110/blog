Via <a href="http://newsoffice.mit.edu/2014/professor-seth-teller-dies">MIT&#x27;s news office</a> I learn that Seth Teller has died, at the young age of 50. Seth primarily worked in robotics and vision, but was also a regular participant at the Symposium on Computational Geometry. For more about his many accomplishments, read the MIT story.
