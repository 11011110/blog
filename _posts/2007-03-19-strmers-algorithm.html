<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St%C3%B8rmer%27s_theorem">Størmer's theorem</a> is really not so much a theorem but an algorithm, for finding pairs of consecutive smooth numbers. <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/2007/stormer.py">I implemented Lehmer's improved algorithm</a>, in Python, as I needed an implementation to generate some examples while expanding the WP article (and maybe more importantly, to check my understanding of Lehmer's paper). It includes some careful bignum implementation of rounding quadratic irrationals, finding continued fraction expansions of them, and solving Pell's equation, which might be useful for other purposes.
