In the foreground, a few bare trees and a chain link fence screen the view of a highway with a car driving leftward (California Highway 73, as seen from University Hills, Irvine). In the middle distance, a higher ridge of land, topped by trees and a church spire (the Newport Beach California Temple of the LDS), fades into the fog.](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/uhfog/2-m.jpg){: style="border-style:solid;border-color:black" }

If you set up a flat sheet (say of glass canes), measure it with a pi divider, and make a disk with the divided diameter, the sheet will roll up exactly around the disk to form a cylinder. (I imagine there's an adjustment for the thickness of the sheet that in practice you would quickly learn to make when using this tool.)

He doesn't mention recent developments (such as [the sublinear bound on the size of a non-collinear set in terms of its diameter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10821) or my own results on non-Euclidean distances) but instead carefully explains what is now the standard proof, by Erdős using intersections of hyperbolas. I was also interested in [the oldest video on the channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzVqh0Bcyx0), on Ron Graham's "77 theorem": all numbers greater than 77 are sums of denominators of Egyptian fraction representations of one. (For the finite set of numbers including 77 that are not, see [OEIS A051882](https://oeis.org/A051882).)

If a graph can be reduced to nothing by repeatedly removing vertices with $$\le2$$ neighbors, then it can be drawn in the plane with straight-line edges, and four edge colors, so that the edges of each color form a non-crossing forest. This answers some questions from one of my old papers, "[Separating thickness from geometric thickness](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0204252)".

* For the past view days Google Scholar seems to be trying to make itself too annoying to use for me <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/113995145467714718)).</span> Some large random fraction of my searches cause it to demand that I prove I'm not a robot by identifying long sequences of captchas of motorcycles and traffic lights and palm trees. Could it be caused by the fact that its search results have become so haphazard that I keep having to re-try similar permutations of the same search phrases to find what I'm looking for? Is it trying to punish me for giving up on Chrome and only using Firefox, or for running with an adblocker? I have no idea but it makes it a much higher priority for me to find something else that works for the same task. Internet Archive Scholar still has far too spotty coverage and MathSciNet and zbMATH only work for serious mathematics, not really for computer science and not for searching for the references for basic textbook material that I often need when editing Wikipedia.

* [Video explainer of the winding problem for spiral galaxies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK0eCgob81k) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/114006449475149310)).</span> If you think of a galaxy as being like the solar system's planets with its stars in concentric nearly-circular orbits, then its arrangement into spiral arms wouldn't be stable: the spirals would wind up tighter as the more central stars orbit more quickly than the ones in the outer arms. So the structure has to be something else – the leading theory is that it's a density wave moving at a different speed from the stars, something like the way slowdowns can propagate through thick traffic (or even stand still) at a different speed than the speed of the traffic itself. But how this structure arises and stays stable apparently remains a bit of a mystery. If you prefer text to video, [another explainer](http://burro.cwru.edu/academics/Astr222/Galaxies/Spiral/spiral.html) also discusses the same issue.
