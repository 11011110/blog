<p>Continuing my very slow project of using a different photo of myself for every tab of <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/">my home page</a>, I just added one of me in my new <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/2006/04/30/math-is-delicious.html">math is delicious T-shirt</a> to <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/recmath.html">my recreational math tab</a>. Cropped from a larger family portrait taken by my father, it joins the mirrored self-portrait I've been using for most of the tabs and Elena's shot of me in Limerick on my <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/contact.html">contact tab</a>.</p>

<p>As if anyone but me cares, but I did write there that I'd post updates of changes...</p>

<p>ETA re the icon: it's from a poster for a 1967 Pink Floyd concert. I'm greatly saddened to learn of Syd Barrett's death today.</p>
