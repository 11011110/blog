<p>I'm getting hit with a lot of comment spam on old posts today, so I'm temporarily disabling new comments, probably until my next substantive post. Email me instead if you have something to say.</p>

<p>Also, an unrelated  reminder: if you have an interest in the future of the annual Symposium on Computational Geometry, responses to <a href="http://valis.cs.uiuc.edu/~sariel/misc/blog/12/10/28/ACM-Poll-2012-v5.pdf">the latest opinion poll</a> are due Monday.</p>
