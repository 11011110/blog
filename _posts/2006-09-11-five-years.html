<p>Everybody else is doing it. And it is very tempting to make a fluffy little post about how I had a very pleasant day sightseeing at the Sagrada Familia and Parc GÃ¼ell, came back from a great dinner around midnight, and made the mistake of turning on BBC. But really, who but me would care?</p>

<p>Instead, <a href="http://liz-marcs.livejournal.com/206303.html">go read this</a>. <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3449870/">And this</a>. <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6210240/">And this</a>. Because it may be too early to get a clear perspective on what happened then, but it's not too early to pay attention to what's been happening since.</p>
