<p>I just put up my photos from <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/nats/card/">Timothy&#x27;s first Little League game of the season</a>. The games are longer this year, 1 1/2 hours instead of only one, and after one hour of shooting the game (and two before that of softball) my attention started to lag. But I had some fun with my fisheye; it&#x27;s best very close to the action, but that&#x27;s possible at this level since it&#x27;s not seriously scored and the ball isn&#x27;t hit or thrown dangerously hard. I&#x27;ll have to try it in the softball dugout as well, though not for the action there. And I wasn&#x27;t the only parent with a big white lens at the game...</p>
