<p>I just put up my photos from <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/nats/card/">Timothy's first Little League game of the season</a>. The games are longer this year, 1 1/2 hours instead of only one, and after one hour of shooting the game (and two before that of softball) my attention started to lag. But I had some fun with my fisheye; it's best very close to the action, but that's possible at this level since it's not seriously scored and the ball isn't hit or thrown dangerously hard. I'll have to try it in the softball dugout as well, though not for the action there. And I wasn't the only parent with a big white lens at the game...</p>
