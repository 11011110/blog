<p>This one was taken on Christmas Eve, as the sun finally broke through after a cold foggy walk on the Mendocino headlands. It's out of order because I took it on my cell phone and then forgot to upload it.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="Mendocino from the headlands" src="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/mendoheadlands/MendoHeadlands-m.jpg" style="border-style:solid;border-color:black;" /></p>

<p>Sara also has <a href="http://statigr.am/p/618476644289143222_54558767">another cell phone shot from the same time and place</a>. By using Instagram, she usually has hers up within minutes of taking a shot, rather faster than I achieved this time.</p>
