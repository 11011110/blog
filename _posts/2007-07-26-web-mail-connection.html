Are you using https rather than unsecured http to connect to web mail accounts such as <a href="https://mail.gmail.com/">Gmail</a>? You should be. <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/07/26/168202">Via Slashdot</a>: <a href="http://arstechnica.com/articles/culture/Deep-packet-inspection-meets-net-neutrality.ars">unscrupulous ISPs are or will soon be paying attention not just to the sources and destinations of your internet traffic, but also to the content, reading your email and possibly even altering it</a>. A bit of a scare piece but a good excuse to make sure you&#x27;re taking reasonable precautions.
