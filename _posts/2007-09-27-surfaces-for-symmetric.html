<p>Inspired by my <a href="{{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2007-09-22-different-kind-of %}">previous post</a> on a truncated-cube Cayley graph for permutations on four elements, I tried looking at similar presentations for larger permutation groups.</p>

<p>In the permutation group \( S_n \) on \( n \) items, let \( x \) denote the operation that swaps the first two elements of a permutation, and \( y \) denote the operation that rotates the remaining \( n-1 \) elements. Then \( xy \) rotates all \( n \) elements by one position, so these operations satisfy the relations \( x^2=1 \), \( y^{n-1}=1 \), and \( (xy)^n=1 \). One can transpose any two adjacent elements by a composition of these operations of the form \( xy)^kx(xy)^{n-k} \), so \( x \) and \( y \) generate the whole symmetric group.</p>

<p>The group presentation
\[
\bigl\langle x,y \mid x^2, y^{n-1}, (xy)^n \bigr\rangle
\]
can be interpreted for \( n\gt 4 \) as defining a <a href="http://www.hadron.org/~hatch/HyperbolicTesselations/5_5_omnitrunc_512x512.gif">tiling of the hyperbolic plane by \( (n-1) \)-gons and \( 2n \)-gons, meeting at vertices with one \( (n-1) \)-gon and two \( 2n \)-gons per vertex</a>. Since this is an infinite tiling, the group presentation defines an infinite Cayley graph of an infinite group, but \( S_n \) is a quotient of this group, and inherits from it a structure as a Cayley graph embedded on a manifold. This embedded Cayley graph for \( S_n \) has the same types of vertices and faces as the hyperbolic tiling, but finitely many of them.</p>

<p>When \( n \) is even (as in the case of the truncated cube for permutations on four items) the \( (n-1) \)-gons of this surface embedding form odd faces, preventing the surface from being an <i>xyz</i> surface in the sense defined in <a href="{{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2007-09-26-topology-of-orthogonal %}">my recent paper</a>. But when \( n \) is odd, we do get an <i>xyz</i> surface, as we may three-color the faces of the embedding. The \( (n-1) \)-gons all get a single color. Each \( 2n \)-gon consists of the \( n \) cyclic rotations of some permutation \( \pi \), together with a set of \( n \) additional permutations that are not cyclic rotations of each other; we may choose \( \pi \) to be the permutation among these cyclic rotations that fixes the first element. With this choice, we can describe the \( 2n \)-gons that are adjacent to the \( 2n \)-gon defined by \( \pi \): they are formed either by transposing adjacent pairs of elements in Ï€ other than the first element, or by applying \( y^{-1} \) to \( \pi \) and cyclically rotating the elements other than the first. When \( n \) is odd, each of these operations changes the parity of the permutation representing the cycle, so the adjacency structure of the \( 2n \)-gons is bipartite and we may two-color these faces.</p>

<p>We may determine the surface formed by \( S_n \) by checking the bipartiteness of the Cayley graph and the Euler characteristic of the surface. \( S_n \) forms a bipartite Cayley graph when \( n \) is odd (as each operation changes the permutation parity) and not when \( n \) is even (as the cycles \( y^{n-1} \) are odd). It has \( n! \) vertices, \( \frac{3}{2}n! \) edges, \( n!/(n-1) \) \( (n-1) \)-gonal faces, and \( (n-1)! \) \( 2n \)-gonal faces.</p>

<p>For instance, for permutations on 5 elements, we get a nice map on a genus-4 oriented surface with 120 vertices, 180 edges, 30 quadrilaterals, and 24 decagons. It is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncation_%28geometry%29">truncation</a> of an even nicer map, with 30 vertices, 60 edges, and 24 pentagons meeting four pentagons per vertex. Geometrically, the surface for the Cayley graph of \( S_5 \) also appears to be the graph-encoded map (GEM) of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_stellated_dodecahedron">small stellated dodecahedron</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_dodecahedron">great dodecahedron</a>, and to be represented itself geometrically as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated_dodecadodecahedron">truncated_dodecadodecahedron</a>:</p>

<p>In this geometric representation, the <i>xyz</i>-surface faces' 3-coloring is clear: we have yellow squares, large blue decagons, and small red 10/3 stars.</p>
