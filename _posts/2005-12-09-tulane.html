I haven&#x27;t seen much about this in the media, and half the colleagues I discussed this with hadn&#x27;t yet heard it, so I&#x27;ll repeat <a href="http://globofthoughts.blogspot.com/2005/12/tulane.html">Siva&#x27;s news</a> that <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/09/AR2005120900163.html">Tulane appears to be shutting down most of its engineering program</a> and laying off 230 faculty.  I have a hard time believing that this sort of move can be good for the long-term interest of the university, both programmatically and in terms of retaining the best of their remaining faculty.  And, though I&#x27;m personally most interested in their closure of EECS, I agree with one of Siva&#x27;s commenters that it&#x27;s especially ironic, given the nature of the disaster that led to Tulane&#x27;s difficulties, that another target of this closure is Tulane&#x27;s Department of Civil Engineering.
