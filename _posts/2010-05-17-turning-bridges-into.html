At one corner of the UCI campus, there&#x27;s a bridge over <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Creek">San Diego Creek</a> that I drive across maybe twice a week. There&#x27;s also a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Creek_bicycle_path">bike path</a> that follows the creek under the bridge. But while looking for some nearby graffiti this weekend I discovered another feature, visible neither from the road nor the bike path: someone has turned one of the concrete buttresses of the bridge into an impromptu climbing wall by cementing small stones onto it. It&#x27;s a traverse rather than a climb, with a short drop onto soft dirt, so no ropes needed. I didn&#x27;t think to bring climbing shoes, so I can&#x27;t report how usable it is, but it seemed like a creative use for an otherwise bare wall.
<br />

<br />
I&#x27;m not convinced I captured much of interest, but I put <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/sdcbcw/index.html">a few photos online</a>. The local swallows don&#x27;t need handholds or footholds to climb, but the&#x27;ve also made their own attachments to the bridge, at the eave just under the edge of the bridge&#x27;s deck; I included a shot of them, too.
