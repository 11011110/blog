For the last week my email has been a casualty of the daylight savings time change, so if I&#x27;ve been more than usually unresponsive, that&#x27;s why. My regular email client wasn&#x27;t working and I was stuck with a difficult to use webmail system as fallback. Today we finally tracked down the problem. Turns out to be a three-way incompatibility between the department&#x27;s newly recompiled IMAP server (needed to deal with the time change), Thunderbird 2.0 beta (which I had been using), and SSL (so my password isn&#x27;t transmitted in the clear). So I&#x27;m back to Thunderbird 1.5 and working again.
<br />

<br />
This mess did convince me to set up a new gmail address: david.eppstein@gmail.com.  It&#x27;s likely that I won&#x27;t check it as regularly as my department mail address, but it could be useful in the future in case something won&#x27;t get through my default spam filtering, and I&#x27;m leaving it as the default for my LJ notifications.
<br />

<b>ETA:</b> I&#x27;m very quickly remembering why I switched to the 2.0 beta in the first place. 1.5 has this nasty habit of getting into a state where none of the controls work, not even the quit command, I have to force-quit to get out of it, and I lose whatever email drafts I was working on... 2.0, despite being beta, was much more stable. I was also becoming quite fond of its new &quot;move again&quot; key-command.
