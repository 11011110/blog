<p>Ileana Streinu is running <a href="http://socg-discussion.blogspot.com/">a discussion of how she thinks theory conference reviewing procedures could be improved</a> on a new blog. It's mostly centered around SoCG, but could be of interest to other similarly-run conferences.</p>

<p>It seems like a good thing, in general, to discuss our procedures, identify what problems they may be causing, and work towards improving them with a careful analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of proposed changes. But I'm a little uncomfortable with the "<a href="http://socg-discussion.blogspot.com/2007/06/discussion-voting-and-ethical-behavior.html">subsequent vote</a>" part of the proposed events there. The subset of the SoCG community that participates in SoCG business meetings is small and self-selected, true, but even more so is the subset of the SoCG community that participates in blogs, and I'm not confident in the disinterestedness of the moderator. Isn't that what we have a steering committee for?</p>

<p><b>ETA:</b> <a href="http://valis.cs.uiuc.edu/blog/?p=536">Sariel is also skeptical</a>. And <a href="http://mybiasedcoin.blogspot.com/2007/06/anti-pc-travel.html">MM argues that the benefits of PC meetings are outweighed by the costs</a>.</p>
