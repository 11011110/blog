title:  'ACM Election slates'

<p>I see the ACM elections are coming up: there's a slate of candidates <a href="http://www.acm.org/sigs/elections">here</a> including candidates for SIGACT chair and member-at-large.</p>

<p>I imagine candidate statements will be available shortly but I don't see them yet.</p>

<p>The two SIGACT chair candidates are Lance Fortnow and Madhu Sudan. I don't have a strong opinion about Madhu, but I am more conflicted about Lance: I think the <a href="http://weblog.fortnow.com/">complexity blog</a> he's been running has been a great thing for the community, and I don't begrudge him his opinions and tastes, but on the other hand I'm unhappy about the possibility of being represented by someone who has been so <a href="http://weblog.fortnow.com/2009/01/soda-and-me.html">open about his disinterest in algorithms research</a>.</p>

<p>I think Lance vs. Madhu is a win-win situation.  You are over-interpreting Lance's post.  He's just saying that he personally does not get quite as excited about algorithms talks as about complexity talks.  That's a far cry from having some anti-algorithms agenda.  (My personal view is that the two areas are really one area from slightly different viewpoints.)  Lance has actually done a fair bit of algorithmic work on stream algorithms and computational economics.</p>
