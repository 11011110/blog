title:  'ACM Election slates'

I see the ACM elections are coming up: there&#x27;s a slate of candidates <a href="http://www.acm.org/sigs/elections">here</a> including candidates for SIGACT chair and member-at-large.
<br />

<br />
I imagine candidate statements will be available shortly but I don&#x27;t see them yet.
<br />

<br />
The two SIGACT chair candidates are Lance Fortnow and Madhu Sudan. I don&#x27;t have a strong opinion about Madhu, but I am more conflicted about Lance: I think the <a href="http://weblog.fortnow.com/">complexity blog</a> he&#x27;s been running has been a great thing for the community, and I don&#x27;t begrudge him his opinions and tastes, but on the other hand I&#x27;m unhappy about the possibility of being represented by someone who has been so <a href="http://weblog.fortnow.com/2009/01/soda-and-me.html">open about his disinterest in algorithms research</a>.

I think Lance vs. Madhu is a win-win situation.  You are over-interpreting Lance&#x27;s post.  He&#x27;s just saying that he personally does not get quite as excited about algorithms talks as about complexity talks.  That&#x27;s a far cry from having some anti-algorithms agenda.  (My personal view is that the two areas are really one area from slightly different viewpoints.)  Lance has actually done a fair bit of algorithmic work on stream algorithms and computational economics.
