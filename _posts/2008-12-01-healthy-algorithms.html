<p>Another one for the blogroll: <a href="http://healthyalgorithms.wordpress.com/">Healthy Algorithms</a>, a blog by Abraham Flaxman, who is doing a postdoc at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation and thinks that health metrics are a <a href="http://healthyalgorithms.wordpress.com/2008/10/31/health-metrics-a-gold-mine-for-applications-of-theory/">gold mine</a> (or some such metaphor that's a little less about earth-raping) for applications of theoretical computer science techniques.</p>

<p>Abraham also has a recent arXiv preprint, on <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.4908">the expected weight of bounded-depth spanning trees of randomly weighted complete graphs</a>, and has been posting on <a href="http://healthyalgorithms.wordpress.com/2008/11/05/mcmc-in-python-pymc-to-sample-uniformly-from-a-convex-body/">Markov chain Monte Carlo generation of random points in convex polytopes</a>. So it's not all <a href="http://healthyalgorithms.wordpress.com/2008/11/21/google-flu/">disease vectors</a> and <a href="http://healthyalgorithms.wordpress.com/2008/10/24/mortality-research-got-you-down/">cute baby animals</a>.</p>
