<a href="http://weblog.fortnow.com/2005/09/soda-rising.html">Lance has finally noticed that SODA is a good conference</a>.  Which sparks a mild flamewar on whether algorithms is a subject that deserves to have a good conference.  <a href="http://geomblog.blogspot.com/2005/09/on-soda.html">Suresh weighs in</a> (ETA: <a href="http://geomblog.blogspot.com/2005/09/michael-finds-elephant.html">Suresh again</a>).

I liked your rejoinder on Lance&#x27;s post to the person bemoaning the stature of algorithms.
