<p>The theory students put on a year-end barbecue party at Mason Park this afternoon and invited all our families. A good time ensued. Kids ran around eating cake and not hitting each other with croquet mallets. Adults climbed trees, threw frisbees at each other and into the lake, and conversed. Large quantities of different kinds of meat were provided. I took a bunch of photos, as usual, but so did everyone else except for Mike G. who left his camera home. <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/tgbbq/">Here are mine, anyway</a>. The ones Diana took of me up the tree with the other four guys are on John&#x27;s card, so not included in this batch. Along with the picnic snapshots I was also experimenting with extreme closeups of faces, so below are a few of those.</p>
