* [Turkey has charged over 700 academics with terrorism for signing a peace petition](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2019/07/01/about-700-academics-have-been-criminally-charged-turkey-their-signatures-petition) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/102367088461002886)). Among the most severely penalized is [Tuna Altınel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuna_Alt%C4%B1nel), a mathematician in France who was arrested visiting family in Turkey, and who [has now been imprisoned for over 50 days](http://math.univ-lyon1.fr/SoutienTunaAltinel/?lang=en) ([via](https://cameroncounts.wordpress.com/2019/05/31/tuna-altnel/)).

* [László Lovász's book "Graphs and Geometry", on geometric representations of graphs](http://web.cs.elte.hu/~lovasz/bookxx/geomgraphbook/geombook2019.01.11.pdf) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/102374639115017977), [via](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20317825)). [The print version](https://bookstore.ams.org/coll-65) should appear in a month or so from the AMS.

* [University of Alaska budget gutted by 40%](https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2019/06/28/huge-budget-cut-university-alaska) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/102381510293748063), [see also](https://www.metafilter.com/181768/We-dont-need-no-stinkin-edumaction)). The total amount cut over the past five years (including this new biggest cut) is [more like 63%, from $522M to $192M](https://www.chronicle.com/article/Unprecedented-in-Our/246596). And [the likely response is to close one of its three main campuses and all 13 smaller community campuses](https://www.npr.org/2019/07/03/738569508/university-of-alaska-readies-for-budget-slash-we-may-likely-never-recover). Ironically, the cause is right-wing insistence on a universal basic income of $3000/person from fuel extraction revenues.

* [The annual Big Internet Math-off — view and vote on your favorites!](https://aperiodical.com/category/the-big-internet-math-off/) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/102385386477969762)). 
The first few matches include [commutativity of log-exponentiation vs weather infovis](https://aperiodical.com/2019/07/the-big-internet-math-off-2019-group-1-alex-corner-vs-lucy-rycroft-smith/), the [geometry of the Sydney Opera House vs straight lines on a donut](https://aperiodical.com/2019/07/the-big-internet-math-off-2019-group-2-marianne-rachel-vs-vincent-pantaloni/), [multiplication tables and muffins](https://aperiodical.com/2019/07/the-big-internet-math-off-2019-group-3-vicky-neale-vs-jim-propp/) and [a video on shapes in La Sagrada Familia (shot on location?!) vs an introduction to fractals](https://aperiodical.com/2019/07/the-big-internet-math-off-2019-group-4-colin-beveridge-vs-kyle-d-evans/). More daily for roughly a month.

* [Chinese scientists guilty of "researching while Asian" in Trump’s America](https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/long-reads/article/3016267/chinese-scientists-guilty-researching-while) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/102390640744960409), [via](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20319936), [see also](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-06-13/the-u-s-is-purging-chinese-americans-from-top-cancer-research)). The story focuses on star cancer researcher [Xifeng Wu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xifeng_Wu), forced to resign from the University of Texas, apparently because she fostered collaboration with Chinese cancer research institutions at the behest of her higher administration.

* [Chris Purcell thinks about graphs with degree sequence $$1,3,3,3,\dots$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@ccppurcell/102133405425258779). They have to have at least one cycle of each parity.

* [A formula for designing lenses with no spherical aberration](https://petapixel.com/2019/07/05/goodbye-aberration-physicist-solves-2000-year-old-optical-problem/) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/102401888807980335), [via](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20369960)). This seems to have little practical value as there was already a numerical solution, and I don't think it handles chromatic aberration, but it's interesting that there is an analytic formula for these shapes.

* Last week I traveled to Milan for the [Symposium on Geometry Processing](https://sgp2019.di.unimi.it/) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/102407039766140849)). They also have an [official twitter stream](https://twitter.com/geometryprocess), mostly consisting of event photos. The sightseeing highlight of my trip was seeing pages of [Da Vinci's Codex Atlanticus at the Ambrosian Library](https://www.ambrosiana.it/en/discover/codex-atlanticus/).

* [Evoboxx](https://boingboing.net/2019/07/08/check-out-this-cool-synthesize.html) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/102412280507996705)), a retro-styled portable device that does only two things: run Conway's Game of Life and generate sounds from it. Not very practical in these days of cell phones but then maybe that's what makes it a fun project. 

* [Modal model theory](http://jdh.hamkins.org/modal-model-theory/) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/102418646790775178)). For graphs, this extends first order logic (where the only quantification is over vertices and the only predicate is adjacency) with operators $$\Diamond$$ and $$\Box$$. $$\Box(F)$$ is true when all supergraphs model $$F$$ and $$\Diamond(F)$$ is true when at least one supergraph models $$F$$. This can express nontrivial graph properties like $$k$$-colorability, and comes in two variants depending on whether you can quantify outside the operators.

* [Very quick video tutorial on how to make the Miura-ori fold](https://www.instagram.com/p/ByH-R4Ql-NA/), by Polly Verity ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/102429787082169299), [via](https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2019/07/new-polly-verity/)).

* [Trávník's smooth self-referential formula](http://jtra.cz/stuff/essays/math-self-reference-smooth/index.html) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/102435762025301458), [via](https://twitter.com/johncarlosbaez/status/1141376710551601152)). It is actually a linked set of formulas, described in a typeset image, that when plotted as described in the image produces the image itself. It follows the same ideas as earlier self-referential formulas like [Tupper's self-referential formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupper%27s_self-referential_formula) but unlike them describes a smooth vector image based on splines instead of a pixelated bitmap.

* [Leiden wall formulas](http://muurformules.nl/) ([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/102444110227078604)). The last time I was in Leiden they were decorating the exterior walls of all their buildings with poems of many different languages. Now they've moved on to the language of mathematics.

* [Numberphile video on Dehn invariants](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYfpSAxGakI) (15-minutes; [$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/102448538574760818)). The Dehn invariant is a value derived from a polyhedron that doesn't change if you cut up the polyhedron into smaller polyhedral pieces and rearrange them into a different polyhedron. It's 0 for the cube and nonzero for other Platonic solids, proving that they can't be cut and rearranged into a cube. See [the Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehn_invariant) for more technical details.
