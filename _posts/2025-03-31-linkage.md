* [Voronoi conjecture for five-dimensional parallelohedra](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05193) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/114241394402134155)),</span> Alexey Garber, [newly published in _Inventiones Mathematicae_](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00222-025-01325-0). A parallelohedron is a polyhedron whose translated copies tile space face-to-face. There are [five types of these in three dimensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallelohedron), all of which are zonohedra, but in higher dimensions they get more complicated. For instance the 4d regular 24-cell is a parallelohedron but not a zonohedron. The Voronoi conjecture relates parallelohedra to [plesiohedra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plesiohedron), the Voronoi cells of symmetric point sets. The Voronoi cells of a lattice are parallelohedra, but [contrary to what MathWorld says](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Parallelohedron.html), not all parallelohedra are Voronoi cells. The ones that are Voronoi cells have a special property: each face is perpendicular to the line connecting its center to the center of the whole parallelohedron.

  According to the Voronoi conjecture, every parallelohedron has an affine transformation taking it to this special form. For instance, in two dimensions this implies: every centrally symmetric hexagon has an affine transformation taking it to a hexagon inscribed in a circle. This has long been known for up to four dimensions but open in higher dimensions. The linked paper finally proves it in five dimensions. It turns out to be much easier to count Voronoi parallelohedra than arbitrary parallelohedra, so one consequence is that we now know exactly how many combinatorially distinct five-dimensional parallelohedra there are: 110,244 of them.

Wang was James H. Rudy professor of computer science, engineering and informatics, director of the Center for Security and Privacy in Informatics, Computing, and Engineering, associate dean for research, ACM Fellow, IEEE Fellow, AAAS Fellow, etc. This does not appear to be immigration-related; he was placed on leave by Indiana two weeks before his house was searched, and the search was by FBI not ICE. Still, because of the current political situation, uninformed speculation is running wild. I do not want to add any of my own but this situation bears continued attention.
