<p><a href="http://blog.sciencenews.org/2006/03/sudoku_numb3rs_1.html">According to Ivars Petersen's MathTrek</a>, tomorrow's episode of <i>Numb3rs</i> involves solving Sudoku puzzles, with a mention of counting how many possible puzzles there are. What this could have to do with antiterrorist investigation is a bit of a mystery to me... I haven't been watching the show (or, really, any TV since the Olympics ended) but it's amusing to see this sort of math get some attention. <a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/numb3rs/ti/activities/Act1_Sudoku_AllsFair_final.pdf">The show's producers also have a pdf classroom worksheet on Sudoku and latin squares</a>.</p>
