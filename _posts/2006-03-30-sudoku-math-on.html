<a href="http://blog.sciencenews.org/2006/03/sudoku_numb3rs_1.html">According to Ivars Petersen&#x27;s MathTrek</a>, tomorrow&#x27;s episode of <i>Numb3rs</i> involves solving Sudoku puzzles, with a mention of counting how many possible puzzles there are. What this could have to do with antiterrorist investigation is a bit of a mystery to me... I haven&#x27;t been watching the show (or, really, any TV since the Olympics ended) but it&#x27;s amusing to see this sort of math get some attention. <a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/numb3rs/ti/activities/Act1_Sudoku_AllsFair_final.pdf">The show&#x27;s producers also have a pdf classroom worksheet on Sudoku and latin squares</a>.

I am addicted to Sudoku! I made an inventory of methods for solving even the most difficult Sudoku. Start with looking for duo&#x27;s, it&#x27;s an eye opener!
