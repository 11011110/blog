Most or all of the following seem destined to be gone, in the US and (for some) the world:
<br />

<br />
Climate change countermeasures and continued research.
<br />
A coordinated response to extreme climate events.
<br />
Regulation of carbon dioxide as a pollutant.
<br />
National parks and wildlife preserves.
<br />
Guaranteed health care.
<br />
State-level limits on how predatory the health care industry can be.
<br />
A recovering economy and continuing tech boom.
<br />
Internet neutrality.
<br />
The minimum wage.
<br />
Social security and medicare.
<br />
The Supreme Court.
<br />
Abortion rights and access to contraception.
<br />
Anti-discrimination laws and same-sex marriage.
<br />
The truth defense from libel.
<br />
No wholesale legal persecution of opposition parties.
<br />
Restrictions on gun ownership.
<br />
Religious freedom for anyone other than Christians.
<br />
Limits on how blatantly Christianity can be used as an excuse for bigotry.
<br />
Redistricting rules that prevent continued gerrymandering.
<br />
Anything resembling adequate polling places in poor and minority districts.
<br />
Universal voter registration.
<br />
Pressure to reduce sexual harassment and sexual assaults in our universities, or anywhere else.
<br />
Reduced or free college tuition for anyone.
<br />
Any hope of reining in the out-of-control racists in our police forces.
<br />
Farm workers, housecleaners, construction workers, food service workers, and all those other people who do the things nobody else wants to do.
<br />
The ability to bring in talented students and workers from other countries.
<br />
NATO and the free Baltic states.
<br />
Nuclear non-proliferation.
<br />
A president who wouldn&#x27;t start a nuclear war based on a whim or personal slight.
<br />

<br />
Clinton could still pull this out, mathematically, but barring a miraculous turnaround in Wisconsin or Arizona there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any remaining path to 270 electoral votes. And with the House and Senate in Republican hands and a free slot on the court there are no checks and balances left; the voters were the last line of defense.
<br />

<br />
Anyone in a nice safe part of the world looking for academic computer scientists? Canada? Iceland? New Zealand?

You are welcome to Iceland, David.

<b>None</b>: &quot;free Baltic states&quot;<br />

Eppstein, these free baltic states are the direct heirs of those who butchered the lithuanian, the latvian, and the estonian jews in concentration camps and in forests during 1941-1945. Maybe you don&#x27;t care, but I do.

And no one threatens their &quot;freedom&quot; (they are about as &quot;free&quot; from US administration as the US state you are currently living in). You don&#x27;t really believe your own bullshit about Russiam, do you?
