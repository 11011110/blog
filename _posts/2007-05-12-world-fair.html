Every year my kids&#x27; school holds a &quot;World Fair&quot; consisting of kids&#x27; activities, local music and dance troupes performing on stage, a fundraising auction for gift baskets made up by various parents (not a very effective way of raising money, I tend to think -- why not just skip the part about buying bundled-together stuff some of which you might like, and give the money directly to the schools?) and vaguely-multicultural meals. This year&#x27;s was a little different, in that it also included some booths describing the culture of a handful of other countries. It&#x27;s still not a very effective way of learning geography, but it is a fun event to bring the kids to. Sara was away at a girl scout beach house sleepover, but Timothy went and enjoyed himself. And of course, I brought my camera. <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/vvwf07/index.html">Photos here</a>...
