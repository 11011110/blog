<p><a href="http://pingmag.jp/2007/03/23/infosthetics-form-follows-data/">Infosthetics: the beauty of data visualization</a>. From Ping (a Japanese magazine, but the article is in English) via <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/60137/blinded-me-with-beautiful-science">MF</a>. Lots of pretty visualizations, with surprisingly clear descriptions of what they visualize.</p>

<p><b>ETA:</b> Ping is syndicated on LJ as <b><a href="http://pingmag.livejournal.com/"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/lj-userinfo.gif" alt="[info]" width="17" height="17" style="vertical-align: bottom; border: 0;" />pingmag</a></b>. I also very much liked their recent article on <a href="http://pingmag.jp/2006/12/11/iranian-typography-now/">Persian calligraphy</a>.</p>
