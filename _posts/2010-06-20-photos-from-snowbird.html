<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/snowbird/index.html">A few photos</a> from <a href="http://11011110.livejournal.com/198487.html">my recent visit to Snowbird</a>. Obviously, I fail at capturing any of the action of the conferences themselves.
<br />

<br />
Two of the shots may need a little explanation. The one below is the Cliff Lodge, the hotel where many of us stayed, reflecting the hillside from which the view was taken; my own reflection is hidden behind the tip of the flag. <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/snowbird/TrucksideGraffitiGarden.html">This other one</a> was painted on the side of a truck, parked near Ichiban Sushi in Salt Lake City; I never managed to determine whether it was graffiti or intentional decoration by the truck owner.
