For the past month or so, until this weekend when they moved out, we&#x27;ve had some squatters on our front porch: a family of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_phoebe">Black Phoebes</a>. They conveniently set up their nest in clear sight of a window over the front door, through which I could aim the camera.
