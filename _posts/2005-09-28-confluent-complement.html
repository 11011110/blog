<p>Henk Meijer has described the confluent graph whose complement isn't confluent, and it's quite simple.  In fact, the nonconfluent part was in <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.CG/0212046">our first paper on confluence</a>: the Petersen graph, minus a vertex, is nonconfluent because it's nonplanar (a subdivision of \( K_{3,3} \)) and has no 4-cycles, so no way for confluence to gain traction.  It turns out that its complement is confluent:</p>
