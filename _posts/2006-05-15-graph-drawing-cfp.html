<b>None</b>: Non-planar graphs - how to print them on a plane?<br />
<b>2006-06-06T21:44:09Z</b><br />
<p>Given an adjacency matrix, what's the best way of getting a plane representation (with 'bridges' if necessary - as few as possible and as nicely laid out as possible)?</p>

<p>Any ideas ?</p>

<p>Crossing minimization is hard in general, but there are a lot of heuristics known. Rather than try to explain it in the limited space for a comment here, I'd suggest consulting a graph drawing text â€” the one I'm using for my graph algorithms class this quarter is <i>Graph Drawing</i> by Di Battista, Eades, Tamassia, and Tollis, and some of the more relevant parts of it to this question are chapter 7 (incremental planarization) and chapter 9 (layered drawing).</p>
