<p>I should have waited a few more days to post about new graph drawing papers on the arXiv, because another nice one just showed up (presumably, for the same reason as <a href="{{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2010-09-05-four-graph-drawing %}">my ones</a>: the <a href="http://www.graphdrawing.org/gd2010/">Graph Drawing 2010</a> proceedings versions are almost due).</p>

<p>It's called <b>Drawing planar graphs of bounded degree with few slopes</b> (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1009.1315">arXiv:1009.1315</a>), by Balázs Keszegh, János Pach, and Dömötör Pálvölgyi. There are several results in it, but the main one is that, for any constant <i>d</i>, there exists another constant <i>s</i> such that the planar graphs of degree at most <i>d</i> can be drawn planarly, with the edges as straight line-segments that have only <i>s</i> different slopes.</p>

<p>The proof is pretty, easy to explain, and uses some important and deep machinery about the geometric representation of graphs: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_packing_theorem">circle packing theorem</a> of Koebe, Andreev, and Thurston. This theorem states that any planar graph can be represented by a system of circles with disjoint interiors, in such a way that the vertices of the graph correspond one-for-one with the circles, and with two vertices connected by an edge if and only if the corresponding circles are tangent. You can then get a planar straight line drawing by putting each vertex at the center of its circle, but that's not what Keszegh et al do.</p>

<p>Instead, they use a modified version of the circle packing theorem that works only on graphs of bounded degree, and imposes an additional constraint on the circles: any two adjacent circles have radii that are within a constant factor of each other. They then superimpose a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree">quadtree</a> on the circles, with the squares of the quadtree subdivided to a small enough size to ensure that there is a quadtree corner near each circle center, and they use these quadtree corners as the locations of the vertices of the drawing.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="Using a quadtree on top of a circle packing to draw planar graphs with few slopes" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/2010/KesPacPal-GD-10.svg" /></p>

<p>Because any two neighboring circles have similar sizes, the corresponding graph vertices will be rounded to quadtree corners at a similar grid resolution, and in the grid of that resolution the two neighboring vertices will be a constant number of grid cells apart from each other. Therefore, the slope is a rational number with small integer numerator and denominator, and there are only a bounded number of possible slopes; for instance in the drawing above the only slopes are –1, 3, 1/3, 5, 1/5, and -3/5.  Although the authors don't emphasize this, their drawing also has bounded angular resolution.</p>

<p>Although pretty in theory, there are some practical issues with their method, partly because circle packings are difficult to calculate exactly and partly because the dependence of \( s \) on \( d \) is badly exponential. Possibly for this reason, the authors also describe alternative methods that allow a small number of bends in the edges but that greatly reduce the number of slopes needed in their drawings.</p>
