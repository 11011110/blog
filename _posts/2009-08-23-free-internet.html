While I&#x27;m waiting for my flight back to California in Calgary airport (YYV), I&#x27;ve been taking advantage of the free (as in free beer) internet here (yay, thank you Calgary!). But it&#x27;s not exactly free as in free speech: even Wikipedia is censored. While viewing biographical articles recently nominated for deletion on Wikipedia (as I often do) I was unable to view one of the articles that (judging from the censorship message and the deletion discussion) was for an actress of the adult variety. Because of this, I was prevented from taking part in the deletion discussion, a highly legitimate use of internet services. I suspect that whatever filtering is happening is keyword based rather than url based, because I can&#x27;t imagine that someone has set up url-based filters for every deservedly obscure Wikipedia article on off-color topics.
<br />

<br />
In the US, I suspect that such censorship in a government facility couldn&#x27;t legally continue if challenged, but I have no idea how the corresponding Canadian laws work. And in this particular case, I suspect I could have broken through the censorship with my campus VPN if I really cared to, and it&#x27;s unlikely I would have cared to participate in that particular discussion, so it&#x27;s more a question of principle than practicality to me. Regardless, I see it as a bit of a worrisome sign: in a future in which non-paid wireless internet is ubiquitous, will we still have free speech?

Surely this is a troll? 

Firstly, I don&#x27;t think the Calgary Airport Authority is a branch of the Canadian government.

Secondly, &quot;he who pays the piper calls the tune&quot;. You are being offered access to a free service -- and this service carries certain limitations. Where&#x27;s the problem?

Yes, if we reach the point where ubiquitous wireless is provided free as a public service, by public organisations, then it will become important to ensure that such services do not restrict freedoms, but that&#x27;s a completely different scenario.

The closest (if fanciful) analogy I can think of for this, is that you would object to some philanthropist founding a library which allowed public access if a condition of the foundation were that the library didn&#x27;t stock any books on computer science.

The airport authority is a private non-profit, according to <a href="http://www.yyc.com/st/airport_authority/corporate_background.htm">this</a>, but the airport still appears to be government land.

And if there were some threat of philanthropic non-CS libraries crowding out any library that dared to carry CS then yes, I would see that as a problem.

I recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Access-Denied-Filtering-Information-Revolution/dp/0262541963">Access Denied: The Practice and Policy of Global Internet Filtering</a> for an interesting discussion of these issues.  The gist that I got from reading it was that the answer was the the Internet free-speech experience in a given country is tending, over time, to converge to the offline free-speech experience in a given country.  But that&#x27;s a pretty broad approximation of what they say.

Thanks for the link; that looks like an interesting book.

To me, the more interesting question is this: why isn&#x27;t free WLAN a standard service at all airports? All other things being more or less equal, I might even choose my flights based on whether I have a connection through an airport with free WLAN or not.

Regarding the Calgary airport WLAN: I didn&#x27;t try to use any kind of VPN, but I was happy to notice that SSH connections were allowed. You can use an SSH tunnel to use a web proxy at your own university, to avoid any censorship. I think this kind of loopholes are intentional: If you access questionable content, then it will be the headache of your own university instead of YYC, as all traces point in that direction. So YYC shouldn&#x27;t have any reason to mind if you circumvent censorship this way.

The biggest problem at Calgary was the lack of power outlets â€” I only saw four of them (that is, two two-outlet pairs) available at the gate I was sitting at. In comparison, my local airport, Orange County, now has large banks of power outlets available, but doesn&#x27;t have free WIFI. I guess if I had to choose one or the other I&#x27;d choose the WIFI but both are important.

The question is whether they&#x27;re censoring to avoid responsibility for carrying the content or to prevent exposing other people near the computer user from seeing questionable content. If they&#x27;re trying to control the public experience, I can see some value in that (I&#x27;d prefer not to have a situation such as the one depicted in <i>Lost in Translation</i> where people are openly viewing porn on a crowded subway), but if they applied that philosophy consistently they would close the loophole too. On the other hand, if it&#x27;s a question of avoiding responsibility for carrying the content, the US common carrier rules make it safer not to filter (if one filters, one is not a common carrier) but again I have no idea whether Canadian law is analogous.
