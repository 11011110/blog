The <a href="{{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2011-09-25-confluence-vs-lombardi %}">GD11 contest graph that I&#x27;ve written about earlier</a> turns out to be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_graph">circle graph</a>. Here&#x27;s a chord diagram representing it:

I&#x27;m looking at this and similar graphs because I&#x27;m trying to understand a result claimed in a STACS 1992 paper by Walter Unger, &quot;The Complexity of Colouring Circle Graphs&quot;, which claims that testing 3-colorability of circle graphs can be done in polynomial time. (More precisely  Unger claims a time bound of <i>O</i>(<i>n</i> log <i>n</i>) if a chord diagram representing the graph is given.) The problem can equivalently be stated as one of finding a three-page <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_embedding">book embedding</a> (if one exists) given a fixed ordering of vertices along the spine of the embedding, or of sorting permutations using three stacks. The paper describes an algorithm that looks for &quot;important subgraphs&quot; and uses them to formulate a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-satisfiability">2-satisfiability</a> instance that is claimed to solve the problem, but many details are missing and there seems to be no journal version filling in the missing details. I think there should be a statute of limitations on these things: a 20-year-old conference announcement that is clearly not a full archival paper and that never was turned into one should be considered a non-result. (The paper does give better details for a different result, that it&#x27;s NP-complete to test 4-colorability of circle graphs.)
<br />

<br />
The contest-graph example shows that it&#x27;s pointless to try to decompose circle graphs into 3-connected components (say) before trying to color them: by making multiple copies of each chord you can make the graph as highly connected as you like without changing its colorability.
<br />

<br />
Coincidentally, another conference paper on 3- and 4-page book embeddings is also missing some important details. It&#x27;s a more famous one, by Yannakakis in STOC 1986, stating that the maximum number of pages needed for book embeddings of planar graphs is exactly four. Yannakakis did publish a journal version of the upper bound (that all planar graphs have four-page book embeddings, in JCSS 1989). But the lower bound construction (the existence of a planar graph requiring four pages), again outlined with many missing details in the conference paper, does not appear in the journal paper. Again, I think the statute of limitations has expired for this claim.

I completely agree with your comments about Yannakakis&#x27; non-proof. For the same reason, Vida Dujmovic and I, in our 2007 paper &quot;Graph treewidth and geometric thickness parameters&quot;, said that determining whether every planar graph has a 3-page book embedding is an open problem.

Thanks; I added that reference to the part of the book embedding Wikipedia article about planar graphs. (It was already being used as a reference elsewhere in the article as well.)
