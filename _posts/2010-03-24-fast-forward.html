This year at <a href="http://2010.eurocg.org/">EuroCG</a> the conference organizers decided to experiment with a &quot;fast-forward session&quot; prior to each session of parallel talks, in which all the speakers got one minute to show a teaser slide and advertise their talks. I&#x27;m curious how well it worked: did it help anyone discover interesting talks to go to that they might otherwise have skipped?
<br />

<br />
The talks are all over now, but I can&#x27;t resist reposting my coauthor&#x27;s teaser slide for <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.0537">our paper</a>.

In my case, it did. Overall, I think it worked very well. It helped to quickly get an idea of the problem that the talk would be about, and more interestingly, of the quality of the talk. And that was of course very useful to decide between the two parallel talks.

Another good property is that you get an idea of the presentation skills of the speaker. Many times have I gone to a presentation (because I found the topic interesting) but ended up understanding nothing. The fast-forward idea reduces the probability of such a &quot;bad event&quot; happening

I second these remarks.  (Nice talk, by they way, Rodrigo. ;))  
I wrote some more thoughts about the conference <a href="http://dirkgerrits.com/2010/03/26/eurocg-2010-in-dortmund/">on my blog</a>.  In short, I think both the organizers and the speakers still need to get used to the concept of fast-forward sessions, but that it is already working out.  In any case, they will be used again for EuroCG 2011.
