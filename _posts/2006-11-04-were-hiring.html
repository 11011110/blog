<a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/employment/employ_faculty.php#cs_prof">Faculty positions available in computer science at UC Irvine</a>. Although we&#x27;re especially interested in textual information retrieval and image processing for this position, it&#x27;s a much less specifically targeted search than we&#x27;ve done in past years, and we&#x27;ll be seriously considering applicants in all areas of CS. And by we I mean me, since I&#x27;m co-chairing the search committee. See the ad for details of the position and how to apply.
