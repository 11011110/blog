<a href="http://abstractnonsense.wordpress.com/2007/02/09/carnival-of-mathematics-inaugural-edition/">The first Carnival of Mathematics is here!</a> I haven't had time to explore yet but there are a lot of fascinating looking links, most from blogs I hadn't heard of but will now start paying more attention to. And if this brings more attention to the unsolved problems I sent in for my own links, that's good too, though I think he's missed the point of my <a href="http://11011110.livejournal.com/86988.html">subgreedy conjecture</a>: it's not about getting better expansions, but about trying to prove termination of a previously defined algorithm by greatly generalizing it. Anyway, thanks, Alon!
