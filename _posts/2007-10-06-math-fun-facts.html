Harvey Mudd College has a <a href="http://www.math.hmc.edu/funfacts/">Math Fun Facts</a> page; recent entries include articles on unfolding projective planes into rectangles, Wallis&#x27; infinite product for Ï€, and Cantor diagonalization. I&#x27;ve linked to them before from my Geometry Junkyard, but now they have an RSS feed, making them that much easier to follow: http://feeds.feedburner.com/MathFunFacts
