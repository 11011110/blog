<a href="http://sportsprof.blogspot.com/2006/02/hilarity-in-espns-ratings-of-top.html">A great example from college sports of misleading statistics</a>.
<br />

<br />
Apparently, especially athletic college freshmen are scored on a 10-point scale by their ability (where these numbers come from and whether they mean anything: unknown to me) and then colleges are ranked by comparing the vector of scores of their incoming frosh.  But the comparison is done by the average of the nonzero scores, so a vector like (6,0,0,0,...) (average: 6) ranks better than a vector that completely dominates it like (9,9,8,6,4,2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1) (average: 2.83).  And this actually happens and skews the rankings...
