Discovered that <a href="http://blogsearch.google.com/">Google Blog Search</a> generates RSS feeds for its results.  Which in retrospect should be very unsurprising, but cool nonetheless.  Scanning through one such feed, I found that <b><a href="http://phenyx.livejournal.com/"><img src="http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif" alt="[info]" width="17" height="17" style="vertical-align: bottom; border: 0;" />phenyx</a></b> is another graph drawer, with a much more detailed set of diary entries from the conference than mine.  <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/phenyx/164007.html">Including one mentioning delta-confluence</a>; good to see someone was paying attention... Hi, Sebastian, whoever you really are.
