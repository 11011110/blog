<p>My family and two others went for a hike Sunday in the hills near the Riverside-Orange county border, on the Ortega Highway; snapshotty collection of photos <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/candystore/">here</a>. The kids thought it was a long way, but we probably only ended up walking about four miles round trip. Still, we had a nice view for our lunch, resupplied ourselves with marzipan, and had enough exercise that when we came back we all wanted to collapse in the pool.</p>

<p>After which we went out to Taco Mesa for a memorial day dinner that couldn't be beat: amazingly good food (I had a calamari burrito) for not very much money, and a McDonalds next door for the unadventurous younger kids. Why has it taken me so long to try going there?</p>

<p>If there's one thing your blog (and photography!) has managed to do, it's convince me that your half of California just isn't so bad.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>You're welcome... I've spent a lot of time in Northern California, so I know what you mean about attitudes there towards that other part of the state. And it took me a few years after I moved here before I really felt that it was home, but I suspect that would be true of any other part of the country or world.</p>

<p>Taco Mesa is indeed one of Orange County's better-kept secrets.  I'm a fan of "taco tuesday", when tacos are $1 each.</p>
