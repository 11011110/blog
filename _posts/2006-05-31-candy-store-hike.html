My family and two others went for a hike Sunday in the hills near the Riverside-Orange county border, on the Ortega Highway; snapshotty collection of photos <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/candystore/">here</a>. The kids thought it was a long way, but we probably only ended up walking about four miles round trip. Still, we had a nice view for our lunch, resupplied ourselves with marzipan, and had enough exercise that when we came back we all wanted to collapse in the pool.
<br />

<br />
After which we went out to Taco Mesa for a memorial day dinner that couldn&#x27;t be beat: amazingly good food (I had a calamari burrito) for not very much money, and a McDonalds next door for the unadventurous younger kids. Why has it taken me so long to try going there?

If there&#x27;s one thing your blog (and photography!) has managed to do, it&#x27;s convince me that your half of California just isn&#x27;t so bad.

Thank you.

You&#x27;re welcome... I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time in Northern California, so I know what you mean about attitudes there towards that other part of the state. And it took me a few years after I moved here before I really felt that it was home, but I suspect that would be true of any other part of the country or world.

Taco Mesa is indeed one of Orange County&#x27;s better-kept secrets.  I&#x27;m a fan of &quot;taco tuesday&quot;, when tacos are $1 each.
