In this work from _8OSME_, Nachat Jatusripitak and Manan Arya show that tessellated fold patterns can fold to tessellations by triangular, square, and hexagonal flashers.

* [David Wood encourages combinatorists to send their papers to broad-focus mathematics journals](https://mathstodon.xyz/@DavidWood/112919357261369522), and when reviewing such submissions, to affirm that they are of broad interest to mathematics, to counter the widespread bias against combinatorics in such journals. See also [Wood's list of combinatorists in editorial positions in these journals](https://mathstodon.xyz/@DavidWood/112919367677253612), and of major journals that have no representation of combinatorics on their editorial boards.

* [Dan Drake collects pilgrimage sites for the mathematical tourist](https://mathstodon.xyz/@ddrake/112926546731607141). That is, places where something important in the history of mathematics happened, not merely places where mathematical content can be found now.

* [Catherine Pfaff shows off some notes from her mathematics research](https://mathstodon.xyz/@PfaffCatherine/112917973612202651), writing "When one isn't sure of what's actually true, sometimes it helps to just compute it all, or at least it feels good to do so."

* [Evolution of the notation for the empty set](https://mathstodon.xyz/@pustam_egr/112942130057660757), with a cute story about Andr√© Weil impressing his daughter as the inventor of the $$\emptyset$$ notation.

* [Fold-and-cut hat and spectre tiles](https://divisbyzero.com/2024/08/14/fold-and-cut-hat-and-spectre-tiles/) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@divbyzero/112961434743524730)).</span> Dave Richeson used the straight skeleton method to construct the downloadable folding patterns for these, which [led me to wonder](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/112964938168920886) how the kite tiling construction of the hat, the [diamond-kite circle packing]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2012-07-23-diamonds-kites-and %}), and the [circle-packing based fold-and-cut construction](https://erikdemaine.org/papers/OSME2001b/) might play together.

  My guess (not having worked it out in detail) is that there is some simple origami molecule that can fold all the kites of the plane tiling by kites into a half-plane, with their boundaries all on the same line segment; that you can then pop the kites of the hat onto the opposite side of the line segment, and that cutting nearly along the line segment (on the side away from the hat's kites) will cut out a hat with a little bit of boundary fringe. But one might not find that boundary fringe part satisfactory.
