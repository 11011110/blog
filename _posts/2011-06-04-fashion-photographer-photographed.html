A week ago (while on campus on the weekend to take some <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:SciencePlaza.jpg">architectural</a> <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:UCI_Donald_Bren_Hall.jpg">photos</a> for Wikipedia) I ran across this scene:
<br />

<br />
<div style="text-align:center"><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/uci11/FashionShoot.html"><img src="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/uci11/FashionShoot-m.jpg" style="border-style:solid;border-color:black;" /></a></div>
<br />

<br />
I think that&#x27;s a pretty good answer to <a href="http://11011110.livejournal.com/216450.html">my earlier question</a> of what real cameras are good for nowadays; I couldn&#x27;t have caught that (or the architecturals) on my cell phone.
<br />

<br />
I have to admit, though, that I&#x27;m getting pretty frustrated with the chromatic aberration on my 17-85/5.6IS. It can be corrected in postprocessing but at some cost in image quality. It would be nice to have something that wide (doesn&#x27;t have to zoom) with better image quality at less than the $2K that the Canon L lenses cost.

Amazon lists 1,120USD for it, so it is significantly below 2k, but has an L level IQ. Build quality is not up to L, but it is not bad either. 

I now carry 17-55/2.8IS and 100/2.8 macro all the time. Last week in a conference (ICASSP), I added laptop also on top of that. Resulting in a combo that was a bit too heavy to lug around. :-)

The issue of point-n-shoot (or cell phone camares) vs DSLR, I think depends a lot on what you shoot. I mostly now shoot insects and lizards (both very common in Singapore), probably point-n-shoot would not work too well...

Thanks for the suggestion. The other possibility I suppose is to use my 15mm fisheye more often and rely on software to straighten it when I want a rectilinear image; I think it&#x27;s quite a bit sharper than my zoom.
