Ran into an interesting lj comm for anatomical illustrations, medical diagrams, and related art today: <b><a href="http://humandress.livejournal.com/"><img src="http://stat.livejournal.com/img/userinfo.gif" alt="[info]" width="17" height="17" style="vertical-align: bottom; border: 0;" />humandress</a></b>. A little macabre at times, perhaps, but &quot;beauty is truth, truth beauty&quot;...
