LiveJournal (or at least my blog on LiveJournal) seems to have been suffering from an infestation of spam comments in the last few days, and the CAPTCHAs don&#x27;t help, so I&#x27;ve temporarily turned anonymous commenting off. This may also affect OpenID-signed comments, I&#x27;m not sure. I hope to be able to turn comments back on soon, but in the meantime if you have something relevant you want to have added to any of my posts you&#x27;re welcome to send me an email and I can add it for you.

I also wish I knew what the ones who leave vague and inane anonymous comments (e.g. the Russian equivalent of &quot;nice post&quot;) without even a url payload think they&#x27;re accomplishing.
