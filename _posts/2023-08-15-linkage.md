This is a polygonal room with two designated points so that, if the walls of the room are lined with mirrors, one of the points cannot see any reflected image of the other. For rooms with curved boundaries you can make regions with nonzero area that cannot see reflections of each other, but for rooms whose angles are all rational fractions of a circle such as Tokarsky's, only a finite set of pairs of points can be mutually invisible. That leaves an intermediate case, polygons with irrational angles, for which the question appears to remain open; see [Wikipedia on the "illumination problem"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illumination_problem) for more.

After a big online outcry, and some [discussion of alternatives](https://mathstodon.xyz/@MedievalMideast@hcommons.social/110838371676478198), Zoom [updated their terms again to drop the idea of using content for AI](https://www.darkreading.com/analytics/following-pushback-zoom-says-it-won-t-use-customer-data-to-train-ai-models).

* [Disproof of the local-global conjecture for integer Apollonian circle packings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02749) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/110866392166634590),</span> [via](https://www.quantamagazine.org/two-students-shoot-down-a-widely-believed-math-conjecture-20230810/)). An Apollonian packing is a fractal pattern generated from an initial 4-tuple of mutually tangent circles (one outside and three inside it) by repeatedly placing another tangent circle into each triangular gap between three circles. When the curvatures (1/radius) of the first four circles are all integers, so are the rest. It was conjectured that, for any such packing, the curvatures include all but finitely many of the numbers in six or eight of the residues modulo 24. A summer research project for two students, Summer Haag and Clyde Kertzer, has shot this conjecture down.

* [Why those mini-golf volcanos are so difficult](https://mathstodon.xyz/@johncarlosbaez/110837164228009336): John Baez explains that for the usual shapes of domes, it's impossible to roll a ball with the right momentum to reach a dead stop at the top in finite time. But a special shape, [Norton's dome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norton%27s_dome), does allow this. The time-reversed path of the ball is non-deterministic: it is consistent for the ball to sit at the peak for any finite length of time before starting to roll down.

* While in Montreal for WADS and CCCG a couple of weeks ago, I took time to photograph some of its abundant street art <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/110884988964160062)).</span> [My photos are now online](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/msa/index.html). They fall into three portions: the neighborhood of Concordia University (where the conferences were held; 12 photos), a bike ride from there along Blvd De Maisonneuve through the Latin Quarter to Le Plateau-Mont-Royal (18 photos), and Ave du Mont-Royal (16 photos).
