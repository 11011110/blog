The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossing_number_(graph_theory)">crossing number</a> of a graph is the minimum number of edge crossings with which it can be drawn. A lot of research in graph drawing has involved algorithms or heuristics for minimizing this number, because drawings with more crossings tend to be less understandable.
<br />

<br />
The traditional story of crossing numbers is that they began with Turán&#x27;s &quot;brick factory problem&quot;, named after the brick factory in which Hungarian mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%E1l_Tur%E1n">Pál Turán</a> was imprisoned by the Nazis during World War II, and his musings on how to design a system of tracks that would have as few crossings as possible. But it turns out (as I found today while looking for something else) the same problem was percolating at the same time in an entirely different field of study: sociology. In 1934, J. L. Moreno invented the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociogram">sociogram</a>, and in 1944, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urie_Bronfenbrenner">Urie Bronfenbrenner</a> wrote (about how to place the vertices in such a drawing): &quot;The arrangement of subjects on the diagram, while haphazard in part, is determined largely by trial and error with the aim of minimizing the number of intersecting lines.&quot; Crossing numbers!
<br />

I haven&#x27;t yet tracked down an online copy of Moreno&#x27;s original publication, or what he says about vertex placement in it (the 1953 second edition is <a href="http://www.asgpp.org/docs/WSS/WSS.html">here</a>), but Bronfenbrenner&#x27;s can be found at JSTOR: Bronfenbrenner, Urie (1944). &quot;<a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/2785096">The graphic presentation of sociometric data</a>&quot;. Sociometry 7 (3): 283–289.
