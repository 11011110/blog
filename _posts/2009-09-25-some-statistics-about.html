After two conferences I&#x27;m too tired to successfully post anything serious. So, since Graph Drawing lacks a public business meeting at which to present these, here instead are some statistics on acceptances and rejections at the conference.
<br />

<br />
It was a bad year to have only one co-author: (Here and in the other chart below, dark blue represents accepted papers and light blue the rejected ones.)
<br />

<br />

<br />
Here are the most popular title words (excluding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_words">stop words</a>), sorted by the acceptance rate of the papers they appeared in. Somehow it pleases me that the two most frequent were &quot;graph&quot; and &quot;drawing&quot;. Also, papers on optimal algorithms for orthogonal grid labeling were unusually unpopular this year.
<br />

<br />

<br />
And finally, what would Graph Drawing be without a drawing of a graph? This one has a vertex for each accepted paper and an edge between two papers that share a co-author. Somehow this looks very different from an equally sparse <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93R%C3%A9nyi_model">Erdős–Rényi random graph</a>: the fact that it&#x27;s built out of cliques (sets of papers with a common co-author) seems very visible.

papers with 9 authors?! can so many people converge to a paper at all?

I don&#x27;t know how it happened in this case, but often papers with this many authors come from a workshop where a group of participants got together to discuss some research problem.
