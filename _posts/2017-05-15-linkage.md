* [Trump administration claims the right to de-citizen people over minor mis-statements in their naturalization papers](http://www.scotusblog.com/2017/04/argument-analysis-concerns-prosecutorial-discretion-likely-lead-ruling-bosnian-serb-immigration-case/). As a naturalized citizen myself, this sort of thing makes me nervous.

* [Marine Le Pen is a plagiarist](http://boingboing.net/2017/05/02/french-far-right-leader-le-pen.html). Meanwhile our own plagiarist-in-high-places and actual Nazi, Sebastian Gorka, maintains his office as one of Trump's top advisors.

* [The TCS Wikipedia project](https://thmatters.wordpress.com/2017/05/02/tcs-wikipedia-project/) ([G+](https://web.archive.org/web/20190218031957/https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/SJ4kL8wj8sy)), aiming to identify and fix shortcomings in Wikipedia's coverage of theoretical computer science topics.

* [This year's new National Academy of Sciences members](http://www.nasonline.org/news-and-multimedia/news/may-2-2017-NAS-Election.html) include theoretical computer scientists Dan Spielman and Madhu Sudan. Congratulations!

* [Creating the never-ending bloom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5p2A5mazEs), a making-of video for John Edmark's 3d mathematical sculptures which, when rotated at the right speed and stroboscopically illuminated, appear to grow and bloom much like the tip of a plant stem.

* [How to tie water in a knot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9bGM9Xke8g). 3d-printed hydrofoils create knotted vortices, which then twist around themselves and uncross.

* [Fibonacci jigsaw puzzle](http://starcage.org/fibonacci_puzzle/fibonacci_puzzle.html) based on the spiral patterns of sunflowers and other plants, can also be reassembled to have a missing piece or an extra piece.

* [Checking whether one polygon is contained within another](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2273108/checking-if-a-polygon-is-contained-in-another-polygon) ([G+](https://web.archive.org/web/20190218031739/https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/Banjm5gGuBN)) is trickier than it looks. It doesn't work to simply test containment at the vertices; you have to look for the edge crossings. But a (complicated) linear time algorithm is possible.

* [Roundup of links on the Purdueâ€“Kaplan merger of public and corporate education](http://www.metafilter.com/166853/Purdue-to-Kaplan-Id-buy-that-for-a-dollar) and [an editorial calling it a massive blunder](https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/world-view/purdue%E2%80%99s-massive-blunder).

* [MathJax shrink-o-matic](https://mathstodon.xyz/@christianp/30343) helps you choose the good parts version of a much longer work.

* [Steve Mould and Matt Parker describe the different types of crystal defects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3RsDIWB7s0) ([G+](https://web.archive.org/web/20190218031435/https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/ZgB2rXgnVra)) with some help from ball bearings and ball-pit balls.

* [Octagonal paving tiles](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/roots-of-unity/math-under-my-feet/) ([G+](https://web.archive.org/web/20190218031326/https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/2ci1TdSc9Wh)) can only work if they're non-convex and have some vertices where only two tiles meet, but are actually used in some places. I've also seen decagonal tiles (in the shape of a convex octagon with a square glued to one side).

* [Why telling good journals from bad ones in fields other than your own is not always easy](https://gavialib.com/2017/02/who-knows-whose-journals/) ([G+](https://web.archive.org/web/20190218031027/https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/RvkNB9nfk1b)) and why bad-journal lists such as Beall's may be necessary.
