<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/math.CO/0606450">Drawings of Planar Graphs with Few Slopes and Segments</a> (with Vida DujmoviÄ‡, Matthew Suderman, and David R. Wood) is now up at the arxiv. It forms half of the journal version of the other three authors&#x27; GD04 paper (the other half is <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/math.CO/0606446">here</a> and concerns nonplanar graphs) with a few additional results to justify my addition as a coauthor, including my previously-unpublished <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/junkyard/dilation-free/">classification of dilation-one planar graphs</a>.
