<a href="http://11011110.livejournal.com/274087.html">When I last saw</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetsuo_Asano">Tetsuo Asano</a>, he was giving a research talk at WADS, and openly worrying that it might be his last one. We all thought it was because of mandatory retirement (still legal in Japan). But, it turns out, no. Instead, <a href="http://www.jaist.ac.jp/profiles/info_e.php?profile_id=00033">he&#x27;s the new president of JAIST</a>. Congratulations, Tetsuo!
<br />

I&#x27;ll probably miss SoCG, in Kyoto this year, but for those who will be going, there will be an associated <a href="http://www.jaist.ac.jp/~otachi/tetsuo65/">workshop in honor of Asano&#x27;s 65th birthday</a>.
