A year ago, for International Women’s Day, I made [a list of mathematics books by women covered by then-new Wikipedia articles]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2020-03-08-mathematics-books-women %}). I thought it would be worthwhile to revisit the same topic and list several more mathematics books with at least one female author, at many different levels of audience, and again covered by new Wikipedia articles. They are (alphabetical by title):

* _[Algorithmic Combinatorics on Partial Words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_Combinatorics_on_Partial_Words)_ (2008), Francine Blanchet-Sadri. Partial words are strings with "don't care" symbols; Blanchet-Sadri looks at the combinatorics of repeated patterns within these strings.

* _[Algorithmic Geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_Geometry)_ (1995), Jean-Daniel Boissonnat and Mariette Yvinec. One of several standard computational geometry textbooks; this is the French one, but it has also been published in translation into English.

Many biomolecules are different than their mirror images; classical examples include sugars, whose mirrored molecules may taste different and have different effects. This undergraduate-level text studies how to model this effect using a combination of graph theory and knot theory.

* _[Women in Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Mathematics)_ (1974), Lynn Osen. This is the one that based its coverage of Hypatia on an early-20th-century children's book that gave her a made-up backstory and attributed made-up modern rationalist quotes to her. Not recommended, and included mainly as a warning not to use this as a reference.

To keep from ending on a sour note, I'll add one more, that I found recently on Wikipedia (although the article there is very old) and I think is worthy of expansion: _[Logic Made Easy: How to Know When Language Deceives You](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_Made_Easy)_ (2004), Deborah J. Bennett, a popular-audience book on how to translate English phrases into logical formalisms and use that translation to understand more clearly what they mean.
