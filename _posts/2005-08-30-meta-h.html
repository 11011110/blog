<p><a href="http://atgdev.elsevier.com/blogs/cleonard/?p=29">Chris Leonard</a> and <a href="http://3dpancakes.typepad.com/ernie/2005/08/hindex.html">Jeff Erickson</a> have recently posted on the "h-index", an idea proposed by the physicists for ranking researchers in the same research area: your h-index is at least \( h \) iff at least \( h \) of the papers you've written each have at least \( h \) citations.  But replacing "researchers" and "citations" in this definition makes the idea a lot more general.</p>

<p>So: say that a research area has meta-h-index at least \( h \), iff at least \( h \) of the researchers in the area each have h-index at least \( h \).  This would give some indication of the size of a community, how tight-knit it is, and how heavily people in that community tend to cite other work.</p>

<p>I wonder what this would tell us, e.g. about different subcommunities of the algorithms and theory research areas?</p>

<p>I'd be wary of broader comparisons using this measure, though, e.g. between CS and physics, because different citation patterns between the fields could overwhelm any other differences.</p>

<p>ETA: <a href="http://geomblog.blogspot.com/2005/08/fun-with-numbers.html">Suresh suggests normalizing the citation counts to reduce the differences between fields</a>. And points out big differences in citation patterns even within areas of computer science that are close enough to theory for him and others to work in both.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to see how this applies to the cryptography community.   I get the feeling sometimes that there are really a few different sub-communities that all attend the same conference and superficially talk about similar things, but maybe don't say a lot to each other. I wonder if the meta-h index bears this out.</p>

<p>I imagine the effect of these internal subdivisions would be to make the meta-h index lower than for similarly sized but more cohesive areas?</p>

<p>The ones I was interested in looking at were computational geometry and graph drawing.  I have the impression that graph drawing is smaller but more inclusive and close-knit, while computational geometry has a few people who are cited a lot and a larger number of people who are off doing their own thing, closer to a star topology, but this is a vague idea and it would be interesting to be able to quantify it.</p>

<p>Why not rank departments this way?  A department has meta-h-index at least h iff at least h of its researchers have h-index at least h.  Then a university has meta-meta-h-index at least h iff at least h of its departments have meta-h-index at least h, and a state has meta-meta-meta-h index h iff at least h of its universities have meta-meta-h-index at least h.</p>

<p>What would California's meta-meta-meta-h-index be?</p>

<p>I'm not convinced you meant this seriously, but there's some merit to this: we can't really compare h numbers across disciplines, because of different citing patterns, but that's not as much of a problem for comparing similar departments in different universities.  On the other hand, the h-numbers of different departments within the same university are still not comparable, so the meta-meta-h level is where it starts to become too meaningless for my taste.</p>

<p>On second thought, I think evan the departmental meta-h is broken.  The problem is that (unlike large-enough research areas) departments typically have too few people in them, relative to the typical size of a department member's h-number.  So, at least for smaller departments, you'd just end up counting the department size instead of anything more informative.</p>

<p>Thanks for the link!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~shirley/hindex">Here it is again</a> for those too lazy to copy and paste. The meta-h rankings look pretty reasonable, with a few surprises â€” how did USC get so much higher than their other rankings?</p>
