* [Photobucket raises its hosting rates to "go away we don't want your business"](https://www.ghacks.net/2017/06/30/photobucket-now-charges-399-for-third-party-hosted-images/), [Flickr kicks out users of competing email servers](http://boingboing.net/2017/06/27/end-times.html), [Unsplash ditches open access](http://www.chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/changes-to-unsplash/64198), and [Dropbox stops photo sharing](https://www.dropbox.com/help/photos-videos/photos-page) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/ayiBSiy67Vp)). This is why I don't like relying on cloud services: they go away or add unacceptable terms of service without warning.

* [How to construct the seams on a tennis ball from four semicircles](http://images.math.cnrs.fr/Voyage-sur-une-balle-de-tennis.html) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/Bh9EzpR9zsV)), or more generally [cover a sphere with rope of a constant width](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/130255/optimal-inspection-path-on-a-sphere).

* [https://research.swtch.com/zip](Zip files that contain themselves) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/3zFddLLxA18)). Or see [this alternative link](https://wgreenberg.github.io/quine.zip/) if you want to work out how to do it as a puzzle without the spoilers.

* [Turn your ascii art into vector graphics!](http://ivanceras.github.io/svgbob-editor/) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/eWPCk5sBqgg), via [MF](http://www.metafilter.com/168064/BobSVGMarkdownHTML)).

An essential reference for randomized algorithm analysis. Not to be confused with [that other Alice book on databases](http://webdam.inria.fr/Alice/) nor with the Alice who's been [saving us from bad "on a computer" patents](https://www.eff.org/alice).

* [Connections between modal logic and bitwise Boolean arithmetic](https://plus.google.com/+DanPiponi/posts/RpwQAD4jTrb) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/3vUsfGMxX8P)). See also a later post where Dan Piponi [connects both modal logic and bit-manipulation to digital circuit design](http://blog.sigfpe.com/2017/07/self-referential-logic-via-self.html).

* [Lensless cameras based on phased arrays](https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21724796-future-photography-flat-cameras-are-about-get-lot-smaller) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/JKcet3oRzqF), via [YC](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14727607)). They don't necessarily cover less area than current cell phone cameras, but they can be a lot flatter.

* [In memory of Alejandro (Alex) LÃ³pez-Ortiz](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/news/memory-professor-alejandro-alex-lopez-ortiz) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/WfdCryGvndu)).

In case you weren't already certain that the Trump administration hates higher education.

* [Pink Pineapple Pavilion](http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2017/07/origami-pineapple-pavilion/) ([G+](https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/SwgCwJpe3Ax)). An outdoor shade structure in southwest England, built of metal and fabric but "based on a piece of origami" by its designers.
