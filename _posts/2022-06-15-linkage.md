* [Claas Voelcker on academic work-life balance](https://thegradient.pub/working-on-the-weekends-an-academic-necessity/) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/108406720822630002),</span> [via](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31562264)). I think we all know that many academics (myself included!) struggle to keep our weekend and evening time free of work-related distractions. Voelcker investigates where this pressure to work comes from (often internally) and suggests that overwork may block creativity; taking time off can make you more productive.

* From a face-up deck of cards, repeatedly deal off the number of cards showing on the top card (counting Jacks as 11, etc.). What's the probability that you empty the deck by dealing out exactly the right number of cards in the last step? [Christian Lawson-Perfect's post](https://mathstodon.xyz/@christianp/108401164015456979) inspired a group discussion leading to the result that, for decks with large numbers of suits, the answer should tend to 1/7, and that for a standard 52-card deck it is approximately 0.1420342593977892.

* Another Wikipedia illustration <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/108415828596664345)):</span> empty regions for the [Euclidean minimum spanning tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_minimum_spanning_tree). If the red vertical segment is to be an MST edge, the outer white lens needs to be empty of other points; this emptiness implies that the edge is part of the relative neighborhood graph. The emptiness of the light blue diameter circle inside the lens defines the Gabriel graph in the same way. The inner rhombus must not only be empty, but disjoint from the rhombi of other edges.

It doesn't say why they did, though. Maybe because it looks cool.

* [Threelds](https://cp4space.hatsya.com/2022/05/25/threelds/) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/108440193859317506)).</span> I have no idea whether it's useful for anything, but a threeld is a pair of fields where the multiplication operation on the inner one forms the addition on the outer one. The finite ones have inner order 3 and outer order 2, or inner order a Mersenne prime and outer order the adjacent power of two, but there also exist infinite ones with inner field of characteristic 0 and outer of characteristic 2.

* Kirk Smith asks Mastodon: "[Do people on here edit/write Wikipedia articles related to your field? and what's your experience/motivation?](https://scholar.social/@kirk/108439384108355311)" There's a conflict here between desiring academic credit for your work, and maintaining the protection of pseudonymity. But the real-world harassment that pseudonymity prevents is real, whereas I think the possibility of getting much academic credit for this sort of work is largely illusory.

* New Wikipedia article: [Staircase paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staircase_paradox) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/108454961367151468)),</span> on the familiar example of staircase curves in a unit square that uniformly converge to the diagonal of the square, while their lengths converge to the wrong number ($$2$$, rather than $$\sqrt2$$). Somehow we don't seem to have already had an article on this example. I'm sure there must be many more published sources on this example than the ones I used; if you think I missed something important, please let me know.

* [Physicists discover never-before seen particle sitting on a tabletop](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=12936) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/108465478766177772)).</span> Peter Woit's headline for this _Not Even Wrong_ post repeats the breathless hype from the churnalism on a new condensed-matter-physics preprint, which promises applications to dark matter and quantum computing and turns out to be much much less. From the comments, it seems that the condensed matter physicists have been guilty of misapplying the tag "Higgs field" for a long time.

* [Yoshimura crushing patterns on the _Inside MathSciNet_ blog](https://blogs.ams.org/beyondreviews/2021/07/18/yoshimura-crush-patterns/) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/108469088531022175)).</span>  I don't think it's accurate to say that a crush pattern and a crease pattern are synonyms, though. One is a description of the output of a crushing process; the other is an input to a folding process that guides you to put the folds into their intended places. The similarity of the crushing pattern and the Yoshimura fold is not coincidental but the purpose is different.

* [Study of all open-access papers on BioMed Central from a month-long window](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2022.05.019) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/108474483987356656),</span> [via](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31660239)) finds that although 42% claim their data to be available on reasonable request, only 7% actually responded and provided their data.

* [Formalization in Lean of Thomas Bloom's proof](https://b-mehta.github.io/unit-fractions/) of the density version of the [Erdős–Graham problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s%E2%80%93Graham_problem) <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/108484103209861017),</span> [via](https://twitter.com/XenaProject/status/1536099892694859777)), according to which every set of integers with positive upper density includes the denominators of an Egyptian fraction representation of one. The blueprint appears to show Theorem 2 of [Bloom's preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03726) as verified, but Theorem 3 (log density) still to go.
