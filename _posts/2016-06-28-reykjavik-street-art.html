<p>Here's the first of two batches of photos from my recent visit to Iceland. This set is from before the conference, when I had most of a day free to wander around Reykjavik. It's mostly of street art from the touristy shopping area where my hotel was located, and graffiti from some rougher looking areas nearby. This shot was the first I had a chance to take, of a building across the street from my hotel:</p>
