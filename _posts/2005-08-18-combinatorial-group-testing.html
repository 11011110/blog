Here are <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/EppGooHir-WADS-05.pdf">Mike Goodrich&#x27;s slides from his talk at WADS</a> on our work with Dan Hirschberg on <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.DS/0505048">combinatorial group testing</a>.  I&#x27;m always impressed by the care Mike puts into selecting clip art for his talks â€” he has a philosophy that every slide should have some graphical elements on it.  My own slides are generally much more plain text and mathematical figures.
