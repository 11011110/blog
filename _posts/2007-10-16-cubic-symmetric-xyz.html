<p>Ed Pegg recently asked me whether various cubic Hamiltonian graphs were xyz graphs, and to test this out I added some code for <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LCFNotation.html">LCF Notation</a> to GraphExamples.py in <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/PADS/">PADS</a> along with several specific graphs that can be described using this notation.</p>

<p>It turns out that most of the named graphs I tried are not xyz, but two of them are: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pappus_graph">Pappus graph</a> and the <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DyckGraph.html">Dyck graph</a>. The Pappus graph was already shown as the rightmost graph in the figure from <a href="{{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2006-06-09-topology-of-xyz %}">this post</a>. The Dyck graph, it turns out, was described indirectly at the bottom of the same post: for any \( n \), one can embed an xyz graph with \( 2n^2 \) points within an \( n\times n\times n \) grid, at the points \( (x,y,z) \) satisfying \( x+y+z\in\{0,1\}\pmod{n} \). For each \( n \), this produces a <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CubicSymmetricGraph.html">cubic symmetric graph</a>: \( n=2 \) gives the cube (the unique 8-vertex cubic symmetric graph), \( n=3 \) gives the Pappus graph (the unique 18-vertex cubic symmetric graph), \( n=4 \) gives the Dyck graph (the unique 32-vertex cubic symmetric graph), etc.</p>

<p>Here's a picture of the xyz embedding of the Dyck graph:</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="xyz representation of the Dyck graph" src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/2007/xyz/dyck.svg" /></p>

<p>There is only one way of partitioning the edges of the Dyck graph into three subsets that form the parallel edge classes of an xyz representation.</p>
