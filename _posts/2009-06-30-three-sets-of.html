<p>With all my traveling, I'd become delinquent at processing my photos, but I've caught up again (it made it easier that I edited the sets down to half a dozen photos each):</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/trcon09/index.html">A school concert</a> in which my son played viola, held at an auditorium at the local Lutheran college.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/netherlands2/index.html">My recent trip to the Netherlands</a> consisting of photos from the sculpture garden at the <a href="http://www.kmm.nl/?lang=en">Kröller-Müller museum</a>, a hike through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zuid-Kennemerland_National_Park">Zuid-Kennemerland National Park</a>, and the view from Marc van Kreveld and Bettina Speckmann's apartment.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/montpellier/index.html">Montpellier, France</a> including a dinner with some other <a href="{{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2009-06-29-report-from-wg %}">WG</a> participants.</p>
