I was last week in Dagstuhl for a workshop on exact algorithms for NP-hard problems, where I talked about <a href="http://11011110.livejournal.com/199317.html">listing maximal cliques</a>.  Some of the other exciting recent work in the area, from the other workshop talks, included Ryan Williams&#x27; connections between exponential time algorithms and circuit lower bounds from his paper at STOC 2010 (closely related to <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ryanw/acc-lbs.pdf">his new announcement that NEXP is not a subset of ACC0</a>), and the work of Lokshtanov, Marx, and Saurabh showing that a large set of treewidth-based dynamic programming algorithms for graph optimization problems cannot be improved without simultaneous improvements to more general-purpose satisfiability solvers, to appear at SODA 2011. 
<br />

While there, I added to Wikipedia an article on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_time_hypothesis">exponential time hypothesis</a>, an important tool in this area for showing close relations between the complexities of different problems, used in both Williams&#x27; and Lokshtanov et al&#x27;s papers. I had the chance to interact with a few people I already knew, and a much larger number that I&#x27;d had some online contact with but not met in person before. And I also found time to take a few photographs of the local scenery. My gallery is now online, <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/dagstuhl/index.html">here</a>.
