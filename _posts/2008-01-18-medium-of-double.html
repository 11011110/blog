Draw a graph, having as its vertices the <a href="http://11011110.livejournal.com/129009.html">double permutations</a> (sequences of two copies each of the numbers 0 through <i>n</i> − 1 such that the first copies of each number are in sorted order), and connect by an edge two sequences that differ by a single transposition of adjacent elements. What is the structure of this graph? I was naively expecting a 1×3×5×7... grid, coming from the enumeration of these objects as double factorials, but no.

It can be seen to be a medium in this example, for <i>n</i> = 3, because it&#x27;s a planar graph in which all interior faces are centrally symmetric, but what about larger values of <i>n</i>?
<br />

<br />
The answer is that the medium structure persists for all <i>n</i>.  A double permutation is a linear extension of a partial order on the 2<i>n</i> symbols occurring in the sequence, where the partial order enforces the constraint on the ordering of the first copies of each number:

<br />
The linear extensions of any partial order, under transposition operations, form a medium, and therefore the graph of double permutations is a partial cube.
