After I noticed that Wikipedia&#x27;s page on &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECCC">ECCC</a>&quot; mentioned three other ECCC&#x27;s but didn&#x27;t mention the ECCC we all know, I decided it was time to add an article on the one true ECCC, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Colloquium_on_Computational_Complexity">Electronic Colloquium on Computational Complexity</a>. But since I don&#x27;t actually use the ECCC (well, technically, I have one paper there but I didn&#x27;t put it there) I&#x27;d appreciate feedback from those who do on whether what I wrote about it is accurate.
<br />

<br />
Of course, the added difficulty is that what we say about it in Wikipedia needs to be not only accurate, but backed up by published sources. So, for instance, it&#x27;s not possible to disparage the email interface as &quot;clunky&quot; or to say that the two-month timeout has caused many decent papers to be rejected unless one can find a better source than <a href="http://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2009/07/eccc.html">Lance&#x27;s blog post from last July</a>.
<br />

<br />
One thing I wondered about when writing this but didn&#x27;t see in any of the sources I found: who funds ECCC? Is it run on some researcher&#x27;s office machine for little or no cost, or does it cost a nontrivial amount of actual money? Does Trier pick up the cost in exchange for the publicity they get for it, does it come from DFG, or somewhere else?

The e-mail interface you talk about in this post has not been used for a year and a half when it changed to a quite reasonable web interface. 

From their EATCS Bulletin article from 1996:  &quot;The project is realized by complexity people without any financial support from outside. However, we have to be thankful to the University of Trier providing all the technical facilities.&quot;   At least that was the early days...
