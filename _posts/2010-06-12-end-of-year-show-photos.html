It&#x27;s the end of the school year, and that means end-of-year performances, and that means photos of end-of-year performances. <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/trcon10/index.html">My son&#x27;s elementary school music concert</a> and <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/littlewomen/index.html">my daughter&#x27;s drama class performance</a>, to be more specific. The drama (a sequence of scenes from <i>Little Women</i>) was enlivened by the way it was set, with the girls trading roles according to which accessories they were wearing.
<br />

<br />
The drama scenes are the first photos I&#x27;ve processed after upgrading to Adobe Photoshop CS4 (I bought the upgrade just a little too soon to get CS5) and it seems to be working really well. It is fast, it doesn&#x27;t need a separate conversion program to handle my camera&#x27;s raw files, and it produces excellent results with very little adjustment needed even in difficult conditions (stage lighting with no flash, and the camera&#x27;s ISO set to the maximum). I&#x27;ve also been using the CS4 version of Illustrator for a few weeks now and I like the changes I&#x27;ve noticed (easier alignment of objects and easier adjustment of the drawing board size, mostly).
