The [UCI Ecological Preserve](http://ecopreserve.ucnrs.org/) is a 60-acre patch of [coastal sage scrub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastal_sage_scrub), adjoining [the housing complex in which I live](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_Hills,_Irvine).

Like most of the rest of the world, I'm stuck at home for an indefinite duration, but the level of lockdown that we're under allows us to go for walks outside, and like many of my neighbors (keeping a safe distance from each other) I took advantage of the opportunity to do so yesterday in the preserve. It was a gorgeous day, with very clear air from the recent rains: so clear that I could see individual buildings in downtown Los Angeles, 40 miles away.

I brought my camera along, but chose to focus on the nearby brush rather than the more distant views. Here's one of my shots:
