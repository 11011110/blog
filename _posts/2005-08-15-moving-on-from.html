<p><a href="http://www.scifi.com/scifiction/periodictable.html">The periodic table of science fiction</a>.  A hundred or so short-shorts, one per element, by one of my favorite authors.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve read anywhere near all of them, but every once in a while I like to browse a few randomly.</p>

<p>And <a href="http://theodoregray.com/PeriodicTable/index.html">the wooden periodic table</a>, awarded the 2002 Ig Nobel prize.  This one takes itself a little more seriously as a periodic table, but it still has lots of interesting photos and short anecdotal text about each element.  And it really is a wooden table.</p>
