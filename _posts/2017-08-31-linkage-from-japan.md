What you get when you make a foam of bubble bath solution and paint, spread it on paper, and then let the bubbles dry and pop.

* [For a democratic society to remain democratic, it must reject democratically chosen acts whose effects are inimical to democracy](http://blog.geomblog.org/2017/08/on-free-speech-gerrymandering-and-self.html). Suresh Venkatasubramanian uses Popper's Paradox of Tolerance (for a tolerant society to remain tolerant, it must be intolerant of intolerance) as an argument against partisan gerrymandering.

* [Paper model of the Villarceau circles on a torus](http://www.cutoutfoldup.com/981-torus-from-villarceau-circles.php) ([G+](https://web.archive.org/web/20190217080744/https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/PuNkdSFChBo), [via](https://mathlesstraveled.com/2017/01/03/paper-torus-with-villarceau-circles/)).

* [Mysteries of turbulence unravelled](http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nature.2017.22474) ([G+](https://web.archive.org/web/20190217080704/https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/EC4pY8EvPy2)). Simulations follow how swirls in a fluid transfer and dissipate energy.

One-dimensional curves cannot form nontrivial braids in four dimensions, but two-dimensional surfaces can. Zsuzsanna Dancso explains how to visualize these in one-dimension lower, by interpreting the braiding dimension as time.

* [Separating fact from speculation in math history](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/roots-of-unity/dont-fall-for-babylonian-trigonometry-hype/) ([G+](https://web.archive.org/web/20190217080336/https://plus.google.com/100003628603413742554/posts/jhd4W95jaKQ)).
