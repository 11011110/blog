<p>Via <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_04/008622.php">Calpundit</a>: <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~leinav/Surnames.pdf">scientists with alphabetically earlier names do better in the academic rat-race</a>.</p>

<p>So does having a blog id that comes before 99% of other LJ's (in ASCII sorted order, statistic made up from no data) help me in any way?</p>

<p>If you're going to change your name, much better to do it before you start publishing. I know some people who did so mid-career (mostly but not entirely due to marriage, even though several of them are male) and it just ends up confusing everyone.</p>

<p>You should change your nick to 00000000 :-).</p>

<p>Or move to China, so that your coauthors would be called Xing, Xiao, Xu, Zhang, Zheng, Yung, Ying, Yu, Zhao, Zhu, Zhou, Wang, Wong, Wu etc. (I have seen references like [ZZZ05].)</p>

<p>Well, too late then: I'm already published as J.L. Nelson.  *shrug* It has a nice ring to it.  Do you know anyone who has published under a pseudonym?  I think it would be great if S.C. Hardson published something someday.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Do you know anyone who has published under a pseudonym?</i></p></blockquote>

<p>For "know" meaning "have heard of", Bourbaki?</p>

<p>Oh, well, I've heard of "him," but I was hoping for a more recent example, such as someone just doing it as a practical joke or to get an idea out in the open without risking one's reputation.  I suppose I'm being very romantic at this point.</p>

<p>You appear at the beginning of practically every list of users (friends lists, etc.) that doesn't have me in it! Way to get noticed!</p>

<p>&nbsp;- 0olong, from the other 1%, who would have spelt it with an o if someone hadn't already taken that name.</p>

<p>Sure, for a definition of "practically every" that only includes the 20-something people whose flist I'm on...</p>

<p>I suppose it does at least put me very early in some group member lists.</p>
