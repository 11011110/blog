So does having a blog id that comes before 99% of other LJ&#x27;s (in ASCII sorted order, statistic made up from no data) help me in any way?

If you&#x27;re going to change your name, much better to do it before you start publishing. I know some people who did so mid-career (mostly but not entirely due to marriage, even though several of them are male) and it just ends up confusing everyone.

You should change your nick to 00000000 :-).

Or move to China, so that your coauthors would be called Xing, Xiao, Xu, Zhang, Zheng, Yung, Ying, Yu, Zhao, Zhu, Zhou, Wang, Wong, Wu etc. (I have seen references like [ZZZ05].)

Well, too late then: I&#x27;m already published as J.L. Nelson.  *shrug* It has a nice ring to it.  Do you know anyone who has published under a pseudonym?  I think it would be great if S.C. Hardson published something someday.

<i>Do you know anyone who has published under a pseudonym?</i>

For &quot;know&quot; meaning &quot;have heard of&quot;, Bourbaki?

Oh, well, I&#x27;ve heard of &quot;him,&quot; but I was hoping for a more recent example, such as someone just doing it as a practical joke or to get an idea out in the open without risking one&#x27;s reputation.  I suppose I&#x27;m being very romantic at this point.

You appear at the beginning of practically every list of users (friends lists, etc.) that doesn&#x27;t have me in it! Way to get noticed!

 - 0olong, from the other 1%, who would have spelt it with an o if someone hadn&#x27;t already taken that name.

Sure, for a definition of &quot;practically every&quot; that only includes the 20-something people whose flist I&#x27;m on...

I suppose it does at least put me very early in some group member lists.
