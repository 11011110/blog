The orthogonal polyhedron shown below has an interesting combination of properties: it is orthogonally convex (any axis-parallel line intersects it in a point, an interval, or the empty set) but not simply-connected.

My first thought on completing this drawing was: its skeleton is a highly symmetric cubic torus graph with 24 vertices...must be the Nauru graph! But it isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertex-transitive_graph">vertex-transitive</a> but, unlike the Nauru graph, not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge-transitive_graph">edge-transitive</a>: the edges that wrap the short way around the torus each belong to only two six-cycles (the two faces on either side of the edge) but the edges that wrap the long way around belong to three (the two faces and their equatorial cycle).
