<a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/search/freesrchabstract.jsp?arnumber=4723109&k2dockey=4723109@ieeecnfs">A bit of a black eye for the IEEE</a>. I suspect it&#x27;s one of those conferences that&#x27;s merely published by IEEE rather than actually sponsored by IEEE, but that distinction will be lost on many. <a href="http://entertainment.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/12/23/2321242">Via Slashdot</a>.

<b>ETA:</b> It&#x27;s since been taken down by the IEEE, but I expected that to happen and saved a copy. It&#x27;s a paper by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_Schlangemann">Herbert Schlangemann</a> in the 2008 Int. Conf. on Computer Science and Software Engineering, December 12-14, in Wuhan, China, titled <i>Towards the Simulation of E-commerce</i>. Abstract: “Recent advances in cooperative technology and classical communication are based entirely on the assumption that the Internet and active networks are not in conﬂict with object-oriented languages. In fact, few information theorists would disagree with the visualization of DHTs that made reﬁning and possibly simulating 8 bit architectures a reality, which embodies the compelling principles of electrical engineering [19]. In this work we better understand how digital-to-analog converters can be applied to the development of e-commerce.”

The phrase I chose to title this posting is part of the first paragraph. There&#x27;s also a footnote: “This work was supported by the automatic CS Paper Generator.” So you can <a href="http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/scigen/">try it yourself</a> and get something that, while not identical, is equally deep and meaningful.

They still make money off of it, right? I think they deserve the ridicule.
