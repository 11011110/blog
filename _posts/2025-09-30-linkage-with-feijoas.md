* The season's first feijoas (aka pineapple guavas) fell from the trees in my front garden (that's how to tell they are ripe). They are the ones in the bowl on the right; other fruit included for scale <span style="white-space:nowrap">([$$\mathbb{M}$$](https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110/115216169683098648)).</span>

![Four ripe green feijoas sit in a small blue pottery bowl on a green marble surface. Next to the bowl are a large green mango, two magenta plums, and a yellow lemon. The largest of the feijoas is comparable in size to the lemon; the other four are smaller, closer to the size of the plums.](https://ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/feijoas/Feijoas-m.jpg){: style="border-style:solid;border-color:black" }

Here's what it might look like inside of one, a square corridor of 100 hexagons capped at both ends by a strip of three quadrilaterals.

The new talk slides are also fairly brief about the main result, instead going into more detail about its motivation in understanding what the shape of a point set tells you about the graphs that can be drawn planarly with its points as vertices.

Imagine melting a cylindrical piece of ice (like you get at many US restaurants). At some point melting will likely break through the cylinder, producing a crescent shape with two sharp points that gradually smooth as the ice continues to melt. That topology change is a singularity, where something discontinuous happens to the ice surface. If you somehow managed to keep your ice toroidal, the point when it becomes an infinitesimally thin ring and then vanishes would be a more complicated singularity.

  Modeling continuously changing surfaces requires understanding their singularities. This paper is on a specific type of surface evolution called  [mean curvature flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_curvature_flow), and shows that its unavoidable singularities (the ones you can't eliminate by perturbing the starting surface) have only a few simple forms: like the kind where you break through a torus to produce two sharp points, unlike the kind where an infinitesimally thin ring vanishes or worse.

  This is the same general area as the proof of the geometrization and Poincaré conjectures using Ricci flow. One difference is that mean curvature flow depends on how the given 2d surface is embedded in 3d; Ricci flow depends only on the intrinsic geometry of a surface, and not its embedding. Another difference is that this new work is on 2d surfaces, but the geometrization and Poincaré conjectures look one dimension higher, at 3d hypersurfaces. You can also look one dimension lower, at curves in the plane, where the mean curvature flow becomes the [curve-shortening flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve-shortening_flow).
