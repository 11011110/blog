Now that the <a href="http://graphdrawing.de/contest2011/gdcontest2011.html">graph drawing contest</a> that I reported on in <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/2011/09/24/report-from-graph.html">my previous post</a> is over, it occurs to me that the structure of the contest graph can be depicted better by a confluent drawing than by the Lombardi drawings of my contest entry:

I thought the toroidal drawing was nice, but it doesn&#x27;t compare to this one!

Here you see everything about the graph nearly instantly, including all 77760 of its symmetries.
