<p>Now that the <a href="http://graphdrawing.de/contest2011/gdcontest2011.html">graph drawing contest</a> that I reported on in <a href="{{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2011-09-24-report-from-graph %}">my previous post</a> is over, it occurs to me that the structure of the contest graph can be depicted better by a confluent drawing than by the Lombardi drawings of my contest entry:</p>

<p>I thought the toroidal drawing was nice, but it doesn't compare to this one!</p>

<p>Here you see everything about the graph nearly instantly, including all 77760 of its symmetries.</p>
