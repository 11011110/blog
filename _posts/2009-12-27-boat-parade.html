<p>We don't have snow or reindeer or (native) pine trees in Orange County, but instead, every year for the past 100 years or so, the boats of Newport Beach have paraded around the harbor at Christmastime decorated in lights. Many of the big expensive houses on shore are also decorated, and throw private parties to rival the public party going on a few feet away on the boardwalks.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/boatparade09/index.html">My photos from this year's event</a> are now online; they also include a bunch of shots of the kids (and one or two of me!) that I took for our annual Christmas card, with a gorgeous sunset over Catalina as backdrop.</p>

<p>Merry (belated) Christmas, all, and a happy New Year!</p>
