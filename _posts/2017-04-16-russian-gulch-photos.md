A couple of weekends ago I returned to Mendocino for a surprise 80th birthday party for my father. There's now nonstop service from Orange County to Santa Rosa that makes this sort of short trip much more convenient: it's only two more hours driving from there rather than four from any other airport we could reach.

Anyway, while there, we took a hike along the Fern Creek trail of Russian Gulch State Park, to the waterfall at the end of the trail. [My photos from the hike](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pix/ferncreek/) are mostly studies of the green spring textures of the area. There is one of the actual waterfall, but because I packed light for the trip I didn't have a wide enough lens to take it all in at once. Here's a photo of a patch of forget-me-nots and horsetails by the side of the trail:
