<p>Via <a href="http://infoweekly.blogspot.com/2008/04/swat08-accepted-papers.html">Mihai</a>, who in turn got it from <a href="http://denseoutliers.blogspot.com/">Joachim</a>: <a href="http://www.dmist.net/swat2008/papers.htm">the Scandinavian Workshop on Algorithm Theory (SWAT) acceptances</a>. In other news, Joachim G. has a blog. You'd think "Joachim G." would be sufficient to identify a theorist uniquely, wouldn't you? But no, this is Joachim Gudmundsson, not Joachim Giesen.</p>

<p>And <a href="http://mybiasedcoin.blogspot.com/2008/04/icalp-list-of-papers-up.html">via Michael M.</a>: <a href="http://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/%7Eleslie/Icalp08AuthorInfo.html">the ICALP track A (algorithms and theory) acceptances</a>.</p>

<p>Mihai also has an accurate description (from his point of view on the SWAT committee) of how the ICALP committee worked. Leslie Goldberg did a great job of making it run smoothly, though, and I think we made a good set of decisions.</p>
