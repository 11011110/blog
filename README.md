The lack of YAML at the top of this file is deliberate.
It is intended to show up only for the GitHub source code for the blog,
not on the blog itself.

This is the source code for the entries in my [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) / [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) blog, located at [11011110.github.io](https://11011110.github.io/blog). It is, more or less, a vanilla installation of Jekyll. For a guide to setting up your own blog in this way, see [Build A Blog With Jekyll And GitHub Pages](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/), _Smashing Magazine_, 2014.
