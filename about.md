    <p>I am David Eppstein, a Distinguished Professor of Computer Science at the
    University of California, Irvine, and an administrator on the
    English-language Wikipedia. See <a
    href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/">my home page at UC
    Irvine</a> or <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:David_Eppstein">my
    Wikipedia user page</a> for more. This is my personal blog, and
    although it may contain material related to my UCI teaching and
    research it is not sponsored by and does not represent the views of
    the university (nor Wikipedia).</p>
    
    <p>This journal's name comes from interpreting my initials as the
    hexadecimal number 0xDE (decimal 222) and then converting the result
    to binary. It was originally located at 11011110.livejournal.com and
    moved to GitHub Pages (with some minor reformatting of old
    posts) in April 2017.</p>

    <p>For comments on recent posts, see the linked entries on
    <a rel="me" href="https://mathstodon.xyz/@11011110">my Mastodon
    account</a>. I also post links to other web pages there, with
    roundups of those links approximately twice monthly here.</p>
